         <t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level
   request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
   self-descriptive messages for flexible interaction with network-based
   hypertext information systems. HTTP is defined by a series of documents
   that collectively form the HTTP/1.1 specification:
</t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
   
               <t>"HTTP Semantics" <xref target="Semantics"/>

               <t>"HTTP Caching" (this document)</t>
   
               <t>"HTTP/1.1 Messaging" <xref target="Messaging"/>

            </list>
         </t>
         <t>
   HTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where
   performance can be improved by the use of response caches. This document
   defines aspects of HTTP related to caching and reusing response
   messages.
</t>
         <iref item="cache"/>
         <t>
   An HTTP cache is a local store of response messages and the
   subsystem that controls storage, retrieval, and deletion of messages in it.
   A cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response time and
   network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent requests. Any client or
   server MAY employ a cache, though a cache cannot be used by a server that
   is acting as a tunnel.
</t>
         <iref item="shared cache"/>
         <iref item="private cache"/>
         <t anchor="shared.and.private.caches">
   A shared cache is a cache that stores responses to be reused
   by more than one user; shared caches are usually (but not always) deployed
   as a part of an intermediary. A private cache, in contrast,
   is dedicated to a single user; often, they are deployed as a component of 
   a user agent.
</t>
         <t>
   The goal of caching in HTTP is to significantly improve performance
   by reusing a prior response message to satisfy a current request.
   A stored response is considered "fresh", as defined in
   <xref target="expiration.model"/>, if the response can be reused without
   "validation" (checking with the origin server to see if the cached response
   remains valid for this request).  A fresh response can therefore
   reduce both latency and network overhead each time it is reused.
   When a cached response is not fresh, it might still be reusable if it can
   be freshened by validation (<xref target="validation.model"/>) or if the
   origin is unavailable (<xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).

       any overflow occurs, even if the calculations are performed with an
       arithmetic type incapable of directly representing that number.

      <section anchor="caching.overview" title="Overview of Cache Operation">
         <iref item="cache entry"/>
         <iref item="cache key"/>
         <t>
   Proper cache operation preserves the semantics of HTTP transfers (<xref target="Semantics"/>) while reducing the transfer of information already
   held in the cache. Although caching is an entirely OPTIONAL feature of
   HTTP, it can be assumed that reusing a cached response is desirable and
   that such reuse is the default behavior when no requirement or local
   configuration prevents it. Therefore, HTTP cache requirements are focused
   on preventing a cache from either storing a non-reusable response or
   reusing a stored response inappropriately, rather than mandating that
   caches always store and reuse particular responses.
</t>
         <t>
   Each cache entry consists of a cache key and one or more
   HTTP responses corresponding to prior requests that used the same key. The
   most common form of cache entry is a successful result of a retrieval
   request: i.e., a 200 (OK) response to a GET request, which
   contains a representation of the resource identified by the request target
   (Section 7.3.1 of <xref target="Semantics"/>). However, it is also possible to cache permanent redirects,
   negative results (e.g., 404 (Not Found)),
   incomplete results (e.g., 206 (Partial Content)), and
   responses to methods other than GET if the method's definition allows such
   caching and defines something suitable for use as a cache key.
</t>
         <iref item="cache key"/>
         <t>
   The primary cache key consists of the request method and
   target URI.  However, since HTTP caches in common use today are typically
   limited to caching responses to GET, many caches simply decline
   other methods and use only the URI as the primary cache key.
</t>
         <t>
   If a request target is subject to content negotiation, its cache entry
   might consist of multiple stored responses, each differentiated by a
   secondary key for the values of the original request's selecting header
   fields (<xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/>).
</t>
         <t>
   A cache is disconnected when it cannot contact the origin
   server or otherwise find a forward path for a given request. A
   disconnected cache can serve stale responses in some circumstances (<xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).

   200 (OK), and the entire response header section has been received, a
   cache MAY store an incomplete response message body if the cache entry is
   recorded as incomplete. Likewise, a 206 (Partial Content)
   response MAY be stored as if it were an incomplete 200
   (OK) cache entry. However, a cache MUST NOT store incomplete or
   partial-content responses if it does not support the Range

   the range units used in those fields.

   A cache MAY complete a stored incomplete response by making a subsequent

   MUST NOT use an incomplete response to answer requests unless the
   response has been made complete or the request is partial and specifies a
   range that is wholly within the incomplete response. A cache MUST NOT

   A response might transfer only a partial representation if the

   field). It can also forward the request with "Cache-Control: max-age=0" or
   "Cache-Control: no-cache" to disambiguate which response to use.

            <t>
   When a cache receives a request that can be satisfied by a stored response
   that has a Vary header field (Section 10.1.4 of <xref target="Semantics"/>),
   it MUST NOT use that response unless all of the selecting header fields
   nominated by the Vary header field match in both the original request
   (i.e., that associated with the stored response), and the presented
   request.
</t>
            <t>
   The selecting header fields from two requests are defined to match if and
   only if those in the first request can be transformed to those in the
   second request by applying any of the following:
</t>
            <t>
               <list style="symbols">
  
                  <t>
     adding or removing whitespace, where allowed in the header field's
     syntax
  </t>
  
                  <t>
     combining multiple header fields with the same field name
     (see Section 4.2 of <xref target="Semantics"/>)
  </t>
  
                  <t>
     normalizing both header field values in a way that is known to have
     identical semantics, according to the header field's specification
     (e.g., reordering field values when order is not significant;
     case-normalization, where values are defined to be case-insensitive)
  </t>

               </list>
            </t>
            <t>
   If (after any normalization that might take place) a header field is absent
   from a request, it can only match another request if it is also absent
   there.
</t>
            <t>
   A Vary header field-value of "*" always fails to match.
</t>
            <t>
   The stored response with matching selecting header fields is known as the
   selected response.
</t>
            <t>
   If multiple selected responses are available (potentially including
   responses without a Vary header field), the cache will need to choose one to use.
   When a selecting header field has a known mechanism for doing so (e.g., qvalues on
   Accept and similar request header fields), that mechanism MAY be
   used to select preferred responses; of the remainder, the most recent
   response (as determined by the Date header field) is used, as
   per <xref target="constructing.responses.from.caches"/>.
</t>
            <t>
   If no selected response is available, the cache cannot satisfy the 
   presented request. Typically, it is forwarded to the origin server 
   in a (possibly conditional; see <xref target="validation.model"/>) request.

            <iref item="fresh"/>
            <iref item="stale"/>
            <t>
   A fresh response is one whose age has not yet exceeded its
   freshness lifetime. Conversely, a stale
   response is one where it has.

            <t>
   A response's freshness lifetime is the length of time
   between its generation by the origin server and its expiration time. An
   explicit expiration time is the time at which the origin
   server intends that a stored response can no longer be used by a cache
   without further validation, whereas a heuristic expiration
   time is assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration time is
   available.
</t>
            <iref item="age"/>
            <t>
   A response's age is the time that has passed since it was
   generated by, or successfully validated with, the origin server.  
</t>
            <t>
   When a response is "fresh" in the cache, it can be used to satisfy
   subsequent requests without contacting the origin server, thereby improving
   efficiency.
</t>
            <t>
   The primary mechanism for determining freshness is for an origin server to
   provide an explicit expiration time in the future, using either the
   <xref target="header.expires" format="none">Expires</xref> header field (<xref target="header.expires"/>) or
   the max-age response directive (<xref target="cache-response-directive.max-age"/>). Generally, origin servers
   will assign future explicit expiration times to responses in the belief
   that the representation is not likely to change in a semantically
   significant way before the expiration time is reached.
</t>
            <t>
   If an origin server wishes to force a cache to validate every request, it
   can assign an explicit expiration time in the past to indicate that the
   response is already stale. Compliant caches will normally validate a stale
   cached response before reusing it for subsequent requests (see <xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).
</t>
            <t>
   Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times,
   caches are also allowed to use a heuristic to determine an expiration time
   under certain circumstances (see <xref target="heuristic.freshness"/>).

            <t>
  The calculation to determine if a response is fresh is:

   Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times, a

   A cache MUST NOT use heuristics to determine freshness when an explicit

   effectively, heuristics can only be used on responses without explicit
   freshness whose status codes are defined as cacheable by default (see

               <t>
   When a cache receives a 304 (Not Modified) response and
   already has one or more stored 200 (OK) responses for the
   applicable cache key, the cache needs to identify which (if any) are to
   be updated by the new information provided, and then do so.
</t>
               <iref item="strong validator"/>
               <t>
   The stored response(s) to update are identified by using the first match
   (if any) of the following:
</t>
               <t>
                  <list style="symbols">
   
                     <t>
     If the new response contains a strong validator (see
     Section 10.2.1 of <xref target="Semantics"/>), then that strong validator
     identifies the selected representation for update. All of the stored
     responses with the same strong validator are identified for update. If
     none of the stored responses contain the same strong validator, then the
     cache MUST NOT use the new response to update any stored responses.
   </t>
   
                     <t>
     If the new response contains a weak validator and that validator
     corresponds to one of the cache's stored responses, then the most
     recent of those matching stored responses is identified for update.
   </t>
   
                     <t>
     If the new response does not include any form of validator (such as in
     the case where a client generates an If-Modified-Since request from a
     source other than the Last-Modified response header field), and there is
     only one stored response, and that stored response also lacks a
     validator, then that stored response is identified for update.

               </t>
               <t>
   For each stored response identified for update, the cache MUST use the
   header fields provided in the 304 (Not Modified) response
   to replace all instances of the corresponding header fields in the stored
   response.

            <section anchor="head.effects" title="Freshening Responses with HEAD">
               <t>
   A response to the HEAD method is identical to what an equivalent request
   made with a GET would have been, except it lacks a body. This property
   of HEAD responses can be used to invalidate or update a cached GET
   response if the more efficient conditional GET request mechanism is not
   available (due to no validators being present in the stored response) or
   if transmission of the representation body is not desired even if it has
   changed.
</t>
               <t>
   When a cache makes an inbound HEAD request for a given request target and
   receives a 200 (OK) response, the cache SHOULD update or
   invalidate each of its stored GET responses that could have been selected
   for that request (see <xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/>).
</t>
               <t>
   For each of the stored responses that could have been selected, if the
   stored response and HEAD response have matching values for any received
   validator fields (ETag and Last-Modified)
   and, if the HEAD response has a Content-Length header field,
   the value of Content-Length matches that of the stored
   response, the cache SHOULD update the stored response as described below;
   otherwise, the cache SHOULD consider the stored response to be stale.
</t>
               <t>
   If a cache updates a stored response with the metadata provided in a HEAD
   response, the cache MUST use the header fields provided in the HEAD
   response to replace all instances of the corresponding header fields in
   the stored response and append new header fields to the stored response's
   header section unless otherwise restricted by the
   <xref target="header.cache-control" format="none">Cache-Control</xref> header field.

            <t>
   Because unsafe request methods (Section 7.2.1 of <xref target="Semantics"/>) such as PUT, POST or DELETE
   have the potential for changing state on the origin server, intervening
   caches can use them to keep their contents up to date.
</t>
            <t>
   A cache MUST invalidate the effective Request URI
   (Section 5.3 of <xref target="Semantics"/>) as well as the URI(s) in the
   Location and Content-Location response header
   fields (if present) when a non-error status code is received in response to
   an unsafe request method.
</t>
            <t>
   However, a cache MUST NOT invalidate a URI from a Location
   or Content-Location response header field if the host part of
   that URI differs from the host part in the effective request URI
   (Section 5.3 of <xref target="Semantics"/>). This helps prevent denial-of-service attacks.
</t>
            <t>
   A cache MUST invalidate the effective request URI 
   (Section 5.3 of <xref target="Semantics"/>) when it receives a non-error response 
   to a request with a method whose safety is unknown.
</t>
            <t>
   Here, a "non-error response" is one with a 2xx (Successful)
   or 3xx (Redirection) status code. "Invalidate" means that
   the cache will either remove all stored responses related to the effective
   request URI or will mark these as "invalid" and in need of a mandatory
   validation before they can be sent in response to a subsequent request.
</t>
            <t>
   Note that this does not guarantee that all appropriate responses are
   invalidated. For example, a state-changing request might invalidate
   responses in the caches it travels through, but relevant responses still
   might be stored in other caches that it has not.

   The "only-if-cached" request directive indicates that the client only
   wishes to obtain a stored response. Caches that honor this request

   The "must-revalidate" response directive indicates that once it has become

   without forwarding it for validation and receiving a successful response;
   see <xref target="validation.model"/>.
</t>
                  <t>
   The must-revalidate directive is necessary to support reliable operation
   for certain protocol features. In all circumstances a cache MUST obey
   the must-revalidate directive; in particular, if a cache is disconnected,
   it MUST generate a 504 (Gateway Timeout) response.
</t>
                  <t>
   The must-revalidate directive ought to be used by servers if and only
   if failure to validate a request on the representation could result in
   incorrect operation, such as a silently unexecuted financial
   transaction.

   in the response that have the field-name(s) listed MUST NOT be sent
   in the response to a subsequent request without successful revalidation
   with the origin server. This allows an origin server to prevent the

   This directive applies to both private and shared caches. "MUST NOT

   For example, consider a hypothetical new response directive called

         <t>
   Applications using HTTP often specify additional forms of caching. For
   example, Web browsers often have history mechanisms such as "Back" buttons
   that can be used to redisplay a representation retrieved earlier in a
   session.
</t>
         <t>
   Likewise, some Web browsers implement caching of images and other assets
   within a page view; they may or may not honor HTTP caching semantics.
</t>
         <t>
   The requirements in this specification do not necessarily apply to how
   applications use data after it is retrieved from a HTTP cache. That is, a
   history mechanism can display a previous representation even if it has
   expired, and an application can use cached data in other ways beyond its
   freshness lifetime.
</t>
         <t>
   This does not prohibit the application from taking HTTP caching into
   account; for example, a history mechanism might tell the user that a view
   is stale, or it might honor cache directives (e.g., Cache-Control:
   no-store).

      <section anchor="security.considerations" title="Security Considerations">
         <t>
   This section is meant to inform developers, information providers, and
   users of known security concerns specific to HTTP caching.
   More general security considerations are addressed in HTTP messaging
   <xref target="Messaging"/> and semantics <xref target="Semantics"/>.
</t>
         <t>
   Caches expose additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of
   the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation.
   Because cache contents persist after an HTTP request is complete, an attack
   on the cache can reveal information long after a user believes that the
   information has been removed from the network. Therefore, cache contents
   need to be protected as sensitive information.
</t>
         <t>
   In particular, various attacks might be amplified by being stored in a
   shared cache; such "cache poisoning" attacks use the cache to distribute a
   malicious payload to many clients, and are especially effective when an
   attacker can use implementation flaws, elevated privileges, or other
   techniques to insert such a response into a cache. One common attack vector
   for cache poisoning is to exploit differences in message parsing on proxies
   and in user agents; see Section 6.3 of <xref target="Messaging"/> for the relevant requirements.
</t>
         <t>
   Likewise, implementation flaws (as well as misunderstanding of cache
   operation) might lead to caching of sensitive information (e.g.,
   authentication credentials) that is thought to be private, exposing it to
   unauthorized parties.
</t>
         <t>
   Furthermore, the very use of a cache can bring about privacy concerns. For
   example, if two users share a cache, and the first one browses to a site,
   the second may be able to detect that the other has been to that site, 
   because the resources from it load more quickly, thanks to the cache.
</t>
         <t>
   Note that the Set-Cookie response header field <xref target="RFC6265"/> does not
