      <t>Experience has shown that identifiers associated with persistent
			names are quite different from identifiers associated with the
			locations of objects.  This is especially true when such names are
			are expected to be stable for a very long time or when they identify
			large and complex entities.
		 In order to allow Uniform Resource Names (URNs) to evolve to
		 meet the needs of the Informational Sciences community and
		 other users, this specification separates the syntax for URNs
		 from the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers
		 (URIs) specified in RFC 3986, updating the latter
		 specification accordingly.</t>
    </abstract>
	
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" anchor="Intro">
	   <t> The Internet community now has many years of experience with both
		  name-type identifiers and location-based identifiers
		  (or "references" for those who are sensitive to the term
		  "identifier" -- see <xref target="LocPerspective"/>).  The
		  primary examples of these two categories are Uniform
		  Resource Names (URNs <xref target="RFC2141"/>
		  <xref target="RFC2141bis"/>) and Uniform Resource Locators
		  (URLs) <xref target="RFC1738"/>). 
		  That experience leads to the conclusion that it is
		  impractical to constrain URNs to the syntax and high-level
		  semantics of URLs. 
		  Generalization from URLs to generic Uniform Resource
		  Identifiers (URIs) <xref target="RFC3986"/>, especially to name-based,
		  high-stability, long-persistence, identifiers such as many
		  URNs,  has failed because the assumed similarities do not
		  actually exist to a sufficient degree.  Ultimately,
		  locators, which typically depend on particular accessing
		  protocols and a specification relative to some physical
		  space or network topology, are simply different creatures
		  from long-persistence, location-independent, object
		  identifiers.  The syntax and semantic constraints that are
		  appropriate for locators are either irrelevant to or
		  interfere with the needs of resource names as a class.
		  That was tolerable as long as the URN system didn't need
		  additional capabilities but experience since RFC 2141 was
		  published has shown that they are, in fact, needed.</t>
	   <t> Even then, it would have been possible to make URNs fit the
		  "generic URI" <xref target="RFC3986"/> bed by inventing a
		  syntax with sufficient escapes and embedding had the latter
		  specification not also specified some semantics for
		  non-locational information.  Whether such escapes and
		  embedding would have been a good idea is another matter:
		  they tend to make syntax more complex, harder for users to
		  understand, and hence more error-prone.</t>
		  
	   <t> This specification updates the Generic URI Syntax
		  specification <xref target="RFC3986"/> to exclude URNs from
		  its coverage.  Put differently, with the publication of this
		  specification, URNs are no longer considered a member of the
		  class of URIs to which RFC 3986 applies.</t>
	   <t><cref>Note in draft: the above leaves it ambiguous as to
		  whether it remains appropriate to call URNs "URIs".  That
		  ambiguity is intentional and, if possible should keep the
		  question part of the "someone else's problem"
		  category.</cref></t>
	   <t>For URLs and such other URIs as may exist or be
		  created in the future, this specification does not change
		  the syntax rules and other 
		  requirements and recommendations of RFC 3986.</t>

		  <list style="numbers">
			 <t> Try to accommodate all of those who think URNs are
				necessary, i.e., that they are distinct from URLs.</t>
			 <t>Try to avoid getting bogged down in declarative/

				correct in the abstract.</t>

	   <!-- Following from Juha's email of 20140321 0905 +0200 with the
		  "structured category system" bit added and other material
	      elided or edited.  -->
	   <t>Content industries (e.g., publishers) and memory
		  organizations (e.g., libraries, archives, and museums)
		  invest a lot of resources on naming things and the topics of
		  naming and classification are important information science
		  issues.
		  Tens, if not hundreds, of millions of persistent
		  identifiers have been assigned during the last decade.</t>
	   <t>Several identifier systems have been developed for
		  persistent and unique identification of resources.
	      <!-- JcK-> all: Given especially the IAB initiative, should
	          we call out DOIs as an example here? -->
	      When there is a real need to preserve something important
		  (such as scientific publications, research data, government
		  publications, etc.) for the long term, URNs or other
		  persistent identifiers are used; URLs (or other generic
		  URIs) are not being used for identification or even linking
		  purposes.</t> 
	   
	   <!-- The location dependent part of URLs indicates the location of the appropriate 
		URN resolver (such as http://urn.fi). These resolvers are maintained by 
		stable organizations such as national libraries. Once GRDS systems are in place, it 
		will no longer be necessary to hard-code heir location into URN strings. Then, but 
		only then, URNs will be truly protocol independent. -->
		<!-- JcK->  Juha: Some URNs today are "truly protocol independent" either
		    because they are just part of a static naming system with
		    names that are compared but never resolved or because the
		    resolution mechanism is fully spelled out in their
		    definitions.  One could make a case that classically ISSNs
		    are an example of the former: while there are mechanisms
		    to resolve them, they are traditionally just spelled out
		    on paper and they are used in a lot of contexts for
		    identification, not retrieval (even if they are retrieved,
		    what is retrieved is descriptive data, not the documents
		    the series.  But there are other URNs that are bound, by
		    their definitions to location abstractions like the
		    URN.ARPA. DNS tree: let's not fall into the trap of
			assuming that all URNs are similar to those used by
			libraries.  -->
		   <!-- JcK->  Andrew, Peter, Barry: concerns about serious
		 persistence might argue strongly for asking IANA to create a
		 change-version-identified archival repository that mirrored
		 URN.ARPA itself.  I understand they already do that for the
		 root zone, so presumably have the tools.   Let's not confuse
		 people by asking now, but an informal conversation with
		 Michelle and Elise in Toronto, followed by a proposal, might
		 be in order.  -->

    <t>Naming and locating, e.g., for library resources, are both
	   complex activities which have  
		different aims. Traditionally, naming and locating resources have been separate 
		activities, and the rules for the former are much more stringent than for the latter. 
		The same principles are being applied to digital materials as
		well as more traditional ones.
		In a library, any book, be it printed or digital, has both unique and persistent
		International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and non-unique
		(each copy has its own location information)  
		and short-lived location information which cannot be trusted in the long run. 
		ISBN never changes, but both shelf locations and Web addresses usually do, 
		many times during the book's life span.</t>
	 <t>   Giving location information a role in identification would
		not only force libraries  
		to adopt different policies for printed and digital content,
		it would also undermine the value of existing identifier
		systems. Let us assume that ten people independently upload a
		copy of an electronic book into different locations in the
		Web. Are all these ten URLs valid identifiers of the book? And
		what is their relation to the ISBN or other identification
		information of the book such as its title?</t>
	 <!-- JcK-> all: For the non-specialists reading this, I thought
	    that the classification comments about Dewey and LC systems
	    were helpful.  Anyone else want them back in?  Cf. the text
	    starting "for many organizations" in bullet 9 below -->

	   <t> From the perspective of the communities who depend on
		  persistent identifiers, critical issues include:
		   <!--  <<>>Peter -->
		   
		  <list style="numbers">
			 <t>Resource identification has to be a managed process. Assigning
			    URIs generally  is not.  Although it may be possible
			    to introduce some level of control to URI assignment,
				a user cannot determine whether some URI is reliable
				or not.</t>
			 <t>Anyone may assign new URIs to resources even if these resources 
				already have proper identifiers assigned to them.
				Claiming that these URIs actually identify something
				undermines the value of proper identifiers.</t>
			   <!-- JcK-> all: The above could be turned into an
			      argument that "URI" is a misnomer and that 3986bis
				  ought to be about URLs.  Let's let W3C make that
				  proposal :-) -->
			 
			 <t>There is no 1:1 relation between the resource identified and URIs.
				An e-book in the Web may be represented as 1-n files (URIs), and a
				single file may contain several books. And books are simple, we need
				to name very complex objects such as research data sets, or some
				component parts within these complex data sets.</t>
			 <t>One resource such as a scientific article is typically available from
				multiple locations, including (for instance) the publisher's document
				supply service, a university's open repositories and other cooperative
				repository systems, legal deposit collections and the
				Internet archive.
			    A resource should have one and only one identifier of
				a given type;
				URIs do not meet this requirement.
			   <!--  <vspace blankLines="1"/><cref>URNs don't either
				   because nothing prevents different types from being
				   used.   Could we say "one identifier of a given
				   type" and leave "type" vague?</cref> -->
			 </t>
			 <t>URIs relate to instances (copies) of resources,
				whereas traditionally identification has much broader
				scope. Identifiers may be assigned to, e.g., an
				immaterial work (such as Hamlet), its expressions
				(e.g. Finnish translation of Hamlet), and
				manifestations of works and expressions (e.g. PDF
				version of Finnish translation of Hamlet). </t>
			 <t>Over time, different resources (or different versions of the
				same resource) may be found from the same non-URN URI.
				<!-- JcK-> all:  "non-URN URI" strikes me as clumsy,
				  but "URI" alone is confusing.
				  If others agree, we should go back to "location" -->
				A user has no way of knowing whether the resource has
				changed. One of the basic principles for proper
				identifier systems is that the same identifier is
				never assigned to another resource.  In general, URIs
				do not meet this requirement.
				<!-- JcK-> all: I think the above is questionable.  URNs
				   must be stable as identifiers, but the stability
				   of what they point to is part of the URN
				   definition.  Consider a hypothetical URN for ISO
				   standards.  URN:ISO:NNNN could be defined to be
					valid.  It looks like a perfectly good name and
					certainly is not a locator.  But, since a date is not
					present, its binding would be to the current version,
					and that changes.  Remember that we had examples
					like "today's weather forecast for Helsinki" as part
					of the pre-URN discussions -->
			 </t>
			 <t>Persistent identification must be available for
				resources which are available only in databases and
				other environments that are often identified today as
				"deep web".
			    URIs for these resources tend to be very complicated
				and it will be difficult to keep them alive even with
				the help of DNS redirection when e.g. the underlying database
				management system changes. </t>
			 <!-- JcK-> Juha: I dropped the text below, not only
				   because it gets into resolution mechanisms, but
				   because, as someone who used to pretend to be a
				   scientific database expert ("scientific" implies, among
				   other things, much longer persistence requirements than
				   the typical bank database), I think you are wrong.
				   That complexity in URIs for database information
				   typically comes out of queries.  If the old and new DBMSs
				   share some fundamental properties, the URI may be stable
				   enough, even with DBMS and domain changes, the
				   redirection would suffice.
			  If a URN is assigned to
				e.g. database record, the URN or HTTP URI may be
				mapped by the URN resolver to a query based on a
				standard protocol supported by the target database
				such as SRU (Search and retrieve via URL,
				http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/). -->

			 <t>The role URI fragment and query could or should have
				in identification is unclear and the statements in RFC
				3986 are definitely problematic from the points of
				view of existing identifier systems and management of
				naming.
<!--				<vspace blankLines="1"/>  -->
				<list style="empty"> 
				<t> Does "fragment" identify a location or a certain section
				of a resource? In the evolving set of URN Internet
				standards, fragment will not be a part of the
				Namespace Specific String. Then fragment only
				indicates a place / segment within the identified
				resource, but does not identify it. If fragment had a
				role in identification, fragments would extend the
				scope of existing standard identifiers to component
				parts of resources.  For instance, anyone could use
				URN based on ISBN + fragment to identify chapters of
				electronic books.</t> 
<!--				<vspace blankLines="1"/> -->
				<t>Things get even more complicated with "query" since
				what the combination of an identifier and a query
				resolves to may not have 
				anything to do with the original resource. For
				instance, a URN based in ISBN + query may resolve to the
				metadata record describing the book. These records
				have their own identifiers which are not based on
				ISBNs.</t>
				<!-- JcK-> all: I've included the above, unedited (in
				   -00) but I'm nervous about it.  I think it borders on an
				attack on URIs rather than part of the narrow argument
				for separation URNs and that broadens our target
				surface without accomplishing nearly enough to be
				worth it. Maybe is can be rewritten to be more of a
				"URNs are not URIs" statement, but I don't have the
				energy to try at the moment. -->

				   the discussion above may belong in 2141bis and/or

			 <t> For many organizations, persistence means
				decades or centuries. Anything that is protocol

      <t>This specification was inspired by a search in the IETF URNBIS WG
		 for other alternatives that would both satisfy the needs of

		 several years and considered many alternatives.  Discussions

		 Andrew Newton, and Peter Saint-Andre during the last
		 quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 were particularly
		 helpful in getting to the conclusion that a conceptual

		 URNs was necessary.  As noted below, Juha Hakala provided
		 much of the text on which <xref target="LocPerspective"/> was
		 based.  Peter Saint-Andre
		 provided significant text in a pre-publication review.

      <t>This memo is not believed to require any action on IANA's
		 part.  In particular, we note that there are a collection of
		 "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" that does not
		 include URNs and a series of URN-specific registries that do
		 not rely on the URI specificstions.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This specification changes the structural syntax and
		 semantics of URNs to make them self-contained (as specified
		 in other documents) rather than making them dependent on
		 generic URI syntax.  It should have no effect on Internet
		 security unless the use of a definition and syntax that are
		 more clear reduces the potential for confusion and
		 consequent vulnerabilities.</t>

	<section title="A More Pragmatic Perspective" anchor="MorePragmatic">
	   <t><cref>The community should decide whether this appendix, or
		  a modified version of it, should remain or be removed at the
		  time of RFC publication.   In principle, it could even be
		  retained by splitting the relevant Section above into two
		  parts and making a variation on the text below into one of
		  them.    Those who think it should be retained are
		  encouraged to supply text.</cref></t> 
	   <t><xref target="LocPerspective"/> provides an explanation of
		  the reasons for this change.  That explanation is not
		  without controversy, especially from those who make
		  different assumptions about the future, or even
		  interpretations of the present, than many members of the
		  community (and especially members of the communities
		  described in that section).  Some of those who do not accept
		  the explanation above simply do not recognize the
		  distinctions on which it, and URNs more generally, are
		  based, including the name-locator distinction.
		  In some cases, opposition to
		  that explanation is quite pronounced, involving fundamental
		  differences in philosophy that move beyond mere differences
		  of opinion.</t>
	   <t> Like most controversies in which one group does not accept
		  the definitions, facts, or logic of another, the differences
		  are unlikely to be resolved by further discussion, no matter
		  how sensible and patient.   The material in this appendix
		  is provided for the benefit of those who cannot
		  accept <xref target="LocPerspective"/> or consider the
		  discussion there to be meaningless.</t>
	   <t>Independent of the details of the discussion above, in the
		  case of URNs, the IETF is faced with a pair of problems  that
		  are ultimately faced sooner or later by all voluntary
		  standards bodies:  nothing except quality and broad
		  community consensus prevents a standard from being ignored
		  in the marketplace and nothing prevents another body from
		  creating a competing standard.  The effort required to
		  create a competing standard can be increased and its
		  potential for confusion can be reduced somewhat by various
		  measures -- measures the IETF has rarely tried to actually
		  use <!-- (e.g., trademarks and trademark and copyright
		  enforcement) --> -- but those measures are rarely effective
		  when the other body is convinced that they have legitimate
		  and significant needs that differ from the original
		  atandard.
		  Because of those problems, the key question for the URN
		  effort is ultimately not whether a clear enough distinction
		  exists between names and locator or location-based
		  information, nor whether "persistent" can be defined clearly
		  enough, nor even whether the communities and requirements
		  described in <xref target="LocPerspective"/> are valid or
		  will be judged valid in retrospect in a few decades or
		  centuries.  Instead, the question is whether the IETF is
		  willing to evolve and adapt the URN definition to
		  accommodate those perceived needs or whether if prefers to
		  have that work done elsewhere, either by adoption in the
		  broader community and marketplace of a different approach
		  or, potentially, even a competing URN standard.  If, in the
		  long run, those other communities and perspectives turn out
		  to be wrong, the additional features will atrophy.  But that
		  would be true whether they are specified and standardized in
		  the IETF or elsewhere.</t>

	<section title="A Plausible Development Scenario" anchor="tuples">
	   <t>NOTE IN DRAFT: this appendix is included in draft -01 to
		  summarize some discussions on the mailing list in May and
		  June 2014 for the convenience of the WG and possible
		  discussions at IETF 90.  It really is not part of this
		  document and will be removed in the next version.</t>
	   <t>The question has come up several times about what a URN
		  syntax might look like when the URI (i.e., RFC 3986)
		  constraints were removed and the questions about matching
		  and resolution mechanisms that have plagued the WG were
		  addressed.</t>
	   <t>One possible answer is that, if some of those questions
		  can be successfully ignored, e.g., by never having the
		  equivalent of query or fragment components treated as part
		  of the URN for matching purposes and by using the same
		  resolution framework for all URN, one could preserve the
		  generic URI syntax, effectively just using this
		  specification to break the link with some of the semantics
		  specified in RFC 3986.  That strategy makes sense only if
		  the IETF is convinced that it understands all present and
		  potential URNs well enough to specify those properties
		  globally, possibly using an IANA registry for pointers to
		  resolution mechanisms (at one per URN NID) for which see
		  below.</t>
	   <t> If the community is less confident that it understands the
		  full range of requirements for future URN namespaces, then
		  one might, for example, generalize URNs and extend RFC 2141
		  so that a URN was, conceptually,
		  <list style="empty">
		      <t>"URN" NID NSS [ServiceRequests...]</t></list>
		</t>
		<t>It will ultimately make a difference whether "a URN" is the
		   complete URN string as above or just urn:NID:NSS or, put
			differently, whether the ServiceRequests are part of the NSS.
			But it makes less difference in the near term than out trying to
			make general URIs work for URNs would suggest.</t>
	    <t>In the above, a ServiceRequest is, again conceptually, a
		   tuple of
		   <list style="empty">
			  <t>ServiceType ComparisonIndicator ServiceTarget
				 RequestParameters...</t>
              </list></t>
		<t>ServiceType is nominally some sort of keyword.
			ComparisonIndicator tells something trying to compare a pair of
			URNs for identity whether that particular ServiceRequest counts
			or should be ignored.  ServiceTarget identifies where the
			ServiceRequest is to be sent and, depending on the ServiceType,
			may be a keyword indicator or, at the risk of descending into
			recursion hell, a URL or URN.  And RequestParameters are
			anything the ServiceType definition says they are.</t>
		<t> Any of those may be
		   <list style="symbols">
			  <t>defined in the NID registration and omitted from
				 (prohibited in) the URN string</t>
			  <t>allowed by the NID registration but explicitly
				 included in the URN string</t>
			  <t>defined in the NID registration as a default but
				 allowed in the URN string as an override</t>
			  <t>prohibited entirely by the NID registration
				 (effectively duplicating the "don't do that" rule of
				 2141 on a per-NID basis).</t>
		   </list>
		   In addition, ServiceTarget might be specified in the NID
		   registration to identify an IANA registry or domain
		   subtree.</t>
		<t>Presumably the NID registration may also specify whether
			anything not required is prohibited, and the other variations on
			that theme.</t>
		<t>Requests/specifications for location information, assorted
			metadata, or model or actual objects themselves are then just
			specialized ServiceRequests.  In particular, "Fragment"
			disappears as a special type of syntax and reappears as a
			Service Request that is applicable to some NIDs and not others
			and whose meaning and action (and how it is "resolved") are
			specified on an NID basis and as above.  "Query" disappears too,
			not because it (or the syntax) are necessarily problematic but
			because the term itself is misleading for many possible types of
			ServiceRequests and therefore causes more confusion than it
			clears up.</t>
		 <t>ALmost independent of the above, unless we globally allow
			or prohibit non-ASCII content in URN strings, the
			registration/ definition of the NID would presumably
			identify what characters are permitted and, if necessary,
			how they are interpreted for matching purposes.</t>
