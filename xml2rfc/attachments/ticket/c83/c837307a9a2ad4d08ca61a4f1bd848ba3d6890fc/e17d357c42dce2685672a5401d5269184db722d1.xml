<!-- Create Table of Contents (ToC) and set some options for it.

     if the document has more than 15 pages. -->

<?rfc tocompact="yes"?>
<!-- If "yes" eliminates blank lines before main section entries. -->
<?rfc tocdepth="3"?>
<!-- Sets the number of levels of sections/subsections... in ToC.

   element-->
<!-- Choose the options for the references. 
     Some like symbolic tags in the references (and citations) and others prefer 
     numbers. The RFC Editor always uses symbolic tags.
     The tags used are the anchor attributes of the references. -->
<?rfc symrefs="yes"?>

<!-- If "yes", causes the references to be sorted in order of tags.
			 This doesn't have any effect unless symrefs is "yes"

<!-- These two save paper: Just setting compact to "yes" makes savings by not starting each 
     main section on a new page but does not omit the blank lines between list items.

<!-- Information about the document.

     For Internet-Drafts, specify attribute "ipr".
     (ipr values are: full3978, noModification3978, noDerivatives3978), 
     (2008 IETF Trust versions: trust200811, noModificationTrust200811, noDerivativeTrust200811
     Also for Internet-Drafts, you must specify a value for attributes "docName" which is 
     typically the file name under which it is filed - but need not be - and,if relevant, 
     "iprExtract".  
     Note that the value for iprExtract is the anchor attribute value of a section (such as 
     a MIB specification) that can be extracted for separate publication, and is only useful 
     when the value of "ipr" is not "full3978".
     "updates" and "obsoletes" attributes can also be specified here,
     their arguments are comma-separated lists of RFC numbers (just
	 the numbers) -->
