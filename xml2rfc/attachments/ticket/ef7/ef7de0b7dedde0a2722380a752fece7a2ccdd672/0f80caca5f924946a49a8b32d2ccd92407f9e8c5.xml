    <abstract>
      <t>   This memo defines a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
	   reply code, 521.  THe code was originally described in an
	   Experimental RFC in 1995 and is in wide use, but has not
	   previously been formally incorporated into SMTP. The code may
	   be used to indicate that an Internet host 
	   does not accept incoming mail. </t>

	 <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
		<t>The SMTP specification <xref target="RFC5321"/> (referred
		   to, along with its various updates, as "SMTP" below) contains a
		   list and discussion of error codes.  This document updates
		   that list with a new code, 521, for use in
		   response to an initial connection.  In that context, it
		   specifically denotes a
		   system that does not receive email or otherwise handle
		   SMTP mail or inquiry transactions.  That code differs from
		   the use of reply code 554, recommended by RFC 5321, because
		   the latter code can be used in a larger variety of
		   situations, including mail that is not accepted for, or
		   from, particular sources, destinations, or addresses.</t>
		<t>This specification updates RFC 5321 to add the new 521
		   code.  That code was first formally proposed in the
		   Experimental <xref target="RFC1846">RFC 1846</xref>; this
		   document updates that specification to standardize the code
		   and provide more specific treatment of it.</t>
		<t>The reader of this document is expected to have reasonable
		   familiarity with the SMTP specification in RFC 5321,
		   particularly its discussion of reply codes and their use
		   and theory.</t>
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
		  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
		  document are to be interpreted as described in
		  <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
	 </section>
		
	 <section title="Background">
	   <t>  Many Internet hosts
		   are not in a position -- whether technically, operationally, or
		   administratively-- to offer email service.  If an SMTP
		   client (sender) attempts to open a mail 
		   connection to a system that does not have an SMTP server, the
		   connection attempt will time out.  SMTP requires that
		   timeouts result in the client queuing the message and
		   retrying it for an extended period.  That behavior will
		   result in wasted resources and long delays in getting an
		   error message back to its originator.</t>
		<t>An alternative is to run a dummy SMTP server on hosts that
		   do not receive mail under any circumstances, having that
		   dummy server return a fatal error reply code in response to
		   any connection-opening attempt.  This document specifies a
		   reply code to be used for that purpose.</t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="The 521 Reply Code">
		 <t> This specification adds the 521 reply code to the
			repertoire specified in SMTP, reserving it for use at
			connection-opening time to indicate that the host does
			not accept email 
			under any circumstances.  It SHOULD be used for dummy SMTP
			servers whose sole purpose is to notify systems that
			attempt to open mail connections that the host never
			accepts mail.  It MAY be used in other situations where
			the intent is to indicate that the host never accepts
			email.  It SHOULD NOT be used for situations in which the
			server rejects mail from particular hosts or addresses or
			in which mail for a particular destination host is not
			accepted; as discussed in SMTP, reply code 554 is more
			appropriate for those conditions.</t>
		 <t>The preferred message to accompany a 521 code is "Host
			does not accept mail".  <!-- optionally preceded by a domain
			name.  Because the code is used at the time of a
			connection opening attempt, the host may not know the
			domain name by which the client attempted to reach it.  If
			its configuration does not allow confidence about that
			domain name, the domain name SHOULD NOT be included lest
			it add confusion rather than clarity. --> </t>
		 <t> Once the 521 reply code is returned instead of the usual
			220, the SMTP session proceeds normally.   If the SMTP
			client attempts to send additional commands other than
			QUIT, the Server MAY either continue sending 521 reply
			codes or simply close the connection.  If the purpose of
			running a dummy SMTP server that returns a 521 code is to
			conserve resources, the latter will usually be
			preferable.</t>
	   </section>

	   <section title="Small details to avoid loose ends">
		  <section title="Specific changes to RFC 5321">
			 <t>This document adds the 521 code, with message "Host
				does not accept mail" to the function group and
				numerical lists (Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3
				respectively) of RFC 5321.  It also adds the 521 code
				to the "CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT" portion of Section
				4.3.2 ("Command-Reply Sequences"), preceding the 554
				code.</t>
		  </section>
		 <!-- <section title="Postmaster">
			  <t>An SMTP server that sends a reply message using a 521
				 code in response to an initial connection is not
				 subject to the postmaster requirement of Section 4.5.1 of
				 RFC 5321.  This should be obvious: if a RCPT command is
				 not allowed, mail addressed to Postmaster cannot be
				 sent.</t> 
		   </section> -->
		   <section title="The RFC 1846 Experiment">
			  <t> By formalizing Response Code 521, this specification
				 ends the experiment proposed in RFC 1846.  That
				 document also discusses general strategies 
				 for hosts that do not accept mail directly.
				 That discussion is out of scope for the present
				 document.</t>
		  </section>
	   </section>

	   <!--
	   <section title="Context and other approaches" anchor="Context">
		  <t>This specification, and the 521 code, are intended to
			 address situations in which an SMTP connection is
			 attempted to a host that does not support SMTP.
			 An alternate approach is to provide information about SMTP
			 non-support in the hope of discouraging such connection
			 attempts.  One way to do that using the DNS is specified
			 as the "null MX" approach <xref target="nullMX"/>.  Even
			 when that approach is used, it is desirable to support a
			 server that will 
			 return this code if a connection is attempted on the
			 SMTP port because client recognition of the special
			 DNS records for null MX is not universal.</t>
	   </section>  -->

	   <section title="Security Considerations">
		  <t>Not running any SMTP server, or running an SMTP server which simply
		   emits fixed strings in response to incoming connections, should provide
		   significantly fewer opportunities for security problems than running
		   a complete SMTP implementation.</t>
	   </section>

	   <section title="Acknowledgments">
		  <t>Alain Durand and Francis Dupont proposed the 521 code in
			 <xref target="RFC1846">RFC 1846</xref>.  They also
			 participated in an extended conversation and provided
			 many useful comments that led to this document.  The
			 document also contains, with their permission, some text
			 copied from that early specification.</t>
		  <t>Discussion of the "null MX" approach and
			 proposal <xref target="nullMX"/> inspired the creation of
			 this specification.</t>
