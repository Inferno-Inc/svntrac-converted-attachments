      <t>Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) is an

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>GMPLS is designed as an out-of-band control plane supporting
      dynamic connection provisioning for any suitable data plane
      technology; including spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or
      fiber to outgoing port or fiber), wavelength-division
      multiplexing (e.g., Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
      (DWDM)), time-division multiplexing (e.g., SONET/SDH, G.709),
      and Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging - Traffic Engineering
      (PBB-TE) and MPLS. In most of these technologies, there are
      Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions
      employed to monitor the health and performance of the
      connections and to trigger data plane (DP) recovery
      mechanisms. Similar to connection provisioning, OAM functions
      follow general principles, but also have some technology
      specific characteristics.</t>

      <t>OAM is an integral part of transport connections. Therefore it is
      required that OAM functions are activated/deactivated in sync with
      connection commissioning/decommissioning; avoiding spurious alarms and
      ensuring consistent operation. In certain technologies, OAM entities are
      inherently established once the connection is set up, while other
      technologies require extra configuration to establish and configure OAM
      entities. In some situations the use of OAM functions, such as Fault
      Management (FM) and Performance Management (PM), may be optional (based
      on network management policies). Hence, the network operator must be
      able to choose which set of OAM functions to apply to specific
      connections and which parameters should be configured and activated. To
      achieve this objective, OAM entities and specific functions must be
      selectively configurable.</t>

      <t>In general, it is required that the management plane and
      control plane connection establishment mechanisms are
      synchronized with OAM establishment and activation. In
      particular, if the GMPLS control plane is employed, it is
      desirable to bind OAM setup and configuration to connection
      establishment signaling to avoid two separate
      management/configuration steps (connection setup followed by OAM
      configuration) which increases delay, processing, and more
      importantly may be prone to misconfiguration errors. Once OAM
      entities are setup and configured, pro-active as well as
      on-demand OAM functions can be activated via the management
      plane. On the other hand, it should be possible to
      activate/deactivate pro-active OAM functions via the GMPLS
      control plane as well. In some situations it may be possible to
      use the GMPLS control plane to control on-demand OAM functions
      too.</t>

      <t>This document describes requirements for OAM configuration
      and control via Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
      Engineering (RSVP-TE). Extensions to the RSVP-TE protocol are
      specified providing a framework to configure and control OAM
      entities along with the capability to carry technology specific
      information. Extensions can be grouped into: generic elements
      that are applicable to any OAM solution; and technology specific
      elements that provide additional configuration parameters, which
      may only be needed for a specific OAM technology. This document
      specifies the technology agnostic elements and specifies the way
      additional technology specific OAM parameters are provided.</t>

      <t>This document addresses end-to-end OAM configuration, that
      is, the setup of OAM entities bound to an end-to-end
      Label-Switched Path (LSP), and configuration and control of OAM
      functions running end-to-end in the LSP. Configuration of OAM
      entities for LSP segments and tandem connections are out of the
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>The mechanisms described in this document provide an additional
      option for bootstrapping OAM that is not intended to replace or
      deprecate the use of other technology specific OAM bootstrapping
      techniques; e.g., LSP Ping <xref target="RFC4379"/> for MPLS networks.
      The procedures specified in this document are intended only for use in
      environments where RSVP-TE signaling is used to set up the LSPs that are
      to be monitored using OAM.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>This section summarizes various technology-specific OAM requirements
      which can be used as a basis for an OAM configuration framework.</t>

      <t>MPLS OAM requirements are described in <xref target="RFC4377"/>,
      which provides requirements to create consistent OAM functionality for
      MPLS networks. The following list is an excerpt of MPLS OAM requirements
      documented in <xref target="RFC4377"/> that bear a direct relevance to
      the discussion set forth in this document.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>It is desired to support the automation of LSP defect detection.
          It is especially important in cases where large numbers of LSPs
          might be tested.</t>

          <t>In particular some LSPs may require automated ingress-LSR to
          egress-LSR testing functionality, while others may not.</t>

          <t>Mechanisms are required to coordinate network responses to
          defects. Such mechanisms may include alarm suppression, translating
          defect signals at technology boundaries, and synchronizing defect
          detection times by setting appropriately bounded detection time
          frames.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>MPLS-TP defines a profile of MPLS targeted at transport applications
      <xref target="RFC5921"/>. This profile specifies the specific MPLS
      characteristics and extensions required to meet transport requirements,
      including providing additional OAM, survivability, and other maintenance
      functions not currently supported by MPLS. Specific OAM requirements for
      MPLS-TP are specified in <xref target="RFC5654"/> and <xref
      target="RFC5860"/>. MPLS-TP poses the following requirements on the
      control plane to configure and control OAM entities:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>From <xref target="RFC5860"/>: OAM functions MUST operate and be
          configurable even in the absence of a control plane. Conversely, it
          SHOULD be possible to configure as well as enable/disable the
          capability to operate OAM functions as part of connectivity
          management, and it SHOULD also be possible to configure as well as
          enable/disable the capability to operate OAM functions after
          connectivity has been established.</t>

          <t>From <xref target="RFC5654"/>: The MPLS-TP control plane MUST
          support the configuration and modification of OAM maintenance points
          as well as the activation/ deactivation of OAM when the transport
          path or transport service is established or modified.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) defines an adjunct
      connectivity monitoring OAM flow to check the liveliness of Ethernet
      networks <xref target="IEEE.802.1Q-2011"/>. With PBB-TE <xref
      target="IEEE.802.1Q-2011"/> Ethernet networks support explicitly-routed
      Ethernet connections. CFM can be used to track the liveliness of PBB-TE
      connections and detect data plane failures. In the IETF, the GMPLS
      controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) (see <xref target="RFC5828"/>
      and <xref target="RFC6060"/>) work extended the GMPLS control plane to
      support the establishment of PBB-TE data plane connections. Without
      control plane support separate management commands would be needed to
      configure and start CFM.</t>

      <t>GMPLS based OAM configuration and control needs to provide a
      general framework to be applicable to a wide range of data plane
      technologies and OAM solutions. There are three typical data
      plane technologies used for transport applications: wavelength
      based such as Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON),
      Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) based such as Synchronous
      Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Synchronous Optical Networking
      (SONET), and packet based such as MPLS-TP <xref
      target="RFC5921"/> and Ethernet PBB-TE <xref
      target="IEEE.802.1Q-2011"/>. For all these data planes, the
      operator MUST be able to configure and control the following OAM
      functions:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>It MUST be possible to explicitly request the setup of OAM
          entities for the signaled LSP and provide specific information for
          the setup if this is required by the technology.</t>

          <t>Control of alarms is important to avoid false alarm indications
          and reporting to the management system. It MUST be possible to
          enable/disable alarms generated by OAM functions. In some cases,
          selective alarm control may be desirable when, for instance, the
          operator is only concerned about critical alarms. Therefore the
          non-service affecting alarms should be inhibited.</t>

          <t>When periodic messages are used for liveliness check (continuity
          check) of LSPs, it MUST be possible to set the frequency of
          messages. This allows proper configuration for fulfilling the
          requirements of the service and/or meeting the detection time
          boundaries posed by possible congruent connectivity check operations
          of higher layer applications. For a network operator to be able to
          balance the trade-off between fast failure detection and data
          overhead, it is beneficial to configure the frequency of continuity
          check messages on a per LSP basis.</t>

          <t>Pro-active Performance Monitoring (PM) functions are used to
          continuously collect information about specific characteristics of
          the connection. For consistent measurement of Service Level
          Agreements (SLAs), it MUST be possible to set common configuration
          parameters for the LSP.</t>

          <t>The extensions MUST allow the operator to use only a
          minimal set of OAM configuration and control features if
          supported by the OAM solution or network management
          policy. Generic OAM parameters and data plane or OAM
          technology specific parameters MUST be supported.</t>
        </list></t>

    <!--Requirements-->

    <section title="RSVP-TE based OAM Configuration">
      <t>In general, two types of maintenance points can be
      distinguished: Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs) and
      Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs). MEPs reside
      at the ends of an LSP and are capable of initiating and
      terminating OAM messages for Fault Management (FM) and
      Performance Monitoring (PM). MIPs on the other hand, are located
      at transit nodes of an LSP and are capable of reacting to some
      OAM messages but otherwise do not initiate messages. Maintenance
      Entity (ME) refers to an association of MEPs and MIPs that are
      provisioned to monitor an LSP.</t>

      <t>When an LSP is signaled, a forwarding association is
      established between endpoints and transit nodes via label
      bindings. This association creates a context for the OAM
      entities monitoring the LSP. On top of this association, OAM
      entities may be configured to unambiguously identify MEs.</t>

      <t>In addition to ME identification parameters, pro-active OAM
      functions (e.g., Continuity Check (CC) and Performance
      Monitoring (PM)) may have additional parameters that require
      configuration as well. In particular, the frequency of periodic
      CC packets and the measurement interval for loss and delay
      measurements may need to be configured.</t>

      <t>The above parameters may be either derived from LSP
      provisioning information, or alternatively, pre-configured
      default values can be used. In the simplest case, the control
      plane MAY provide information on whether or not OAM entities
      need to be setup for the signaled LSP. If OAM entities are
      created, control plane signaling MUST also provide a means to
      activate/deactivate OAM message flows and associated alarms.</t>

      <t>OAM identifiers, as well as the configuration of OAM functions, are
      technology specific (i.e., vary depending on the data plane technology
      and the chosen OAM solution). In addition, for any given data plane
      technology, a set of OAM solutions may be applicable. Therefore, the OAM
      configuration framework allows selecting a specific OAM solution to be
      used for the signaled LSP and provides means to carry detailed OAM
      configuration information in technology specific TLVs.</t>

      <t> Administrative Status Information is carried in the
      ADMIN_STATUS Object.  The Administrative Status Information is
      described in [RFC3471], the ADMIN_STATUS Object is specified for
      RSVP-TE in [RFC3473]. Two bits are allocated for the
      administrative control of OAM monitoring: the "OAM Flows
      Enabled" (M) and "OAM Alarms Enabled" (O) bits.  When the "OAM
      Flows Enabled" bit is set, OAM mechanisms MUST be enabled; if it
      is cleared, OAM mechanisms MUST be disabled.  When the "OAM
      Alarms Enabled" bit is set OAM triggered alarms are enabled and
      associated consequent actions MUST be executed including the
      notification to the management system.  When this bit is
      cleared, alarms are suppressed and no action SHOULD be executed
      and the management system SHOULD NOT be notified.</t>

      <t>The LSP_ATTRIBUTES and the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects
      are defined in [RFC5420] to provide means to signal LSP
      attributes and options in the form of TLVs.  Options and
      attributes signaled in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object can be passed
      transparently through LSRs not supporting a particular option or
      attribute, while the contents of the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
      object MUST be examined and processed by each LSR. One bit "OAM
      MEP entities desired" is allocated in the LSP Attributes Flags
      TLV to be used in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  If the "OAM MEP
      entities desired" bit is set it is indicating that the
      establishment of OAM MEP entities are required at the endpoints
      of the signaled LSP. One bit "OAM MIP entities desired" is
      allocated in the LSP Attributes Flags TLV to be used in the
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUES objects. If the "OAM
      MIP entities desired" bit is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES Flags TLV
      in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object, it is indicating that the
      establishment of OAM MIP entities is required at every transit
      node of the signaled LSP.</t>

      <section title="Establishment of OAM Entities and Functions">
        <t>In order to avoid spurious alarms, OAM functions should be
        setup and enabled in the appropriate order. When using the
        GMPLS control plane for both LSP establishment and to enable
        OAM functions on the LSPs, the control of both processes is
        bound to RSVP-TE message exchanges.</t>

        <t>An LSP may be signaled and established without OAM
        configuration first, and OAM entities may be added later with
        a subsequent re-signaling of the LSP. Alternatively, the LSP
        may be setup with OAM entities with the first signaling of the
        LSP. The below procedures apply to both cases.</t>

        <t>Before initiating a Path message with OAM Configuration
        information, an initiating node MUST establish and configure
        the corresponding OAM entities locally. But until the LSP is
        established, OAM source functions MUST NOT start sending any
        OAM messages. In the case of bidirectional connections, in
        addition to the OAM source function, the initiator node MUST
        set up the OAM sink function and prepare it to receive OAM
        messages. During this time the OAM alarms MUST be suppressed
        (e.g., due to missing or unidentified OAM messages). To
        achieve OAM alarm suppression, Path message MUST be sent with
        the "OAM Alarms Enabled" ADMIN_STATUS flag cleared.</t>

        <t>When the Path message arrives at the receiver, the remote
        end MUST establish and configure OAM entities according to the
        OAM information provided in the Path message. If this is not
        possible, a PathErr message SHOULD be sent and neither the OAM
        entities nor the LSP SHOULD be established. If OAM entities
        are established successfully, the OAM sink function MUST be
        prepared to receive OAM messages, but MUST NOT generate any
        OAM alarms (e.g., due to missing or unidentified OAM
        messages). In the case of bidirectional connections, in
        addition to the OAM sink function, an OAM source function MUST
        be set up and, according to the requested configuration, the
        OAM source function MUST start sending OAM messages. Then a
        Resv message MUST be sent back, including the LSP_Attributes
        Flags TLV, with the appropriate setting of the "OAM MEP
        entities desired" and "OAM MIP entities desired" flags, and the
        OAM Configuration TLV that corresponds to the established and
        configured OAM entities and functions. Depending on the OAM
        technology, some elements of the OAM Configuration TLV MAY be
        updated/changed; i.e., if the remote end is not supporting a
        certain OAM configuration it may suggest an alternative
        setting, which may or may not be accepted by the initiator of
        the Path message. If it is accepted, the initiator will
        reconfigure its OAM functions according to the information
        received in the Resv message. If the alternate setting is not
        acceptable a ResvErr message MAY be sent tearing down the LSP.
        Details of this operation are technology specific and should
        be described in accompanying technology specific
        documents.</t>

        <t>When the initiating side receives the Resv message, it
        completes any pending OAM configuration and enables the OAM
        source function to send OAM messages.</t>

        <t>After this exchange, OAM entities are established and
        configured for the LSP and OAM messages are exchanged. OAM
        alarms can now be enabled. The initiator, during the period
        when OAM alarms are disabled, sends a Path message with "OAM
        Alarms Enabled" ADMIN_STATUS flag set. The receiving node
        enables the OAM alarms after processing the Path message. The
        initiator enables OAM alarms after it receives the Resv
        message. Data plane OAM is now fully functional.</t>

	<t>In case an egress LSR does not support the extensions
	defined in this document, according to <xref
	target="RFC5420"/>, it will silently ignore the new LSP
	Attributes Flags as well as the TLVs carrying additional OAM
	configuration information, and therefore no error will be
	raised that would notify the ingress LSR about the missing OAM
	configuration actions on the egress side. However, as
	described above, an egress LSR conformant to the specification
	of this document will set the LSP Attributes Flags and include
	the OAM Configuration TLV in the Resv message indicating the
	configuration of the OAM mechanisms, therefore an ingress LSR
	by detecting the missing information in the Resv message will
	be able to recognize that the remote end does not support the
	OAM configuration functionality and therefore it SHOULD tear
	down the LSP, and if appropriate, signal the LSP without any
	OAM configuration information.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Adjustment of OAM Parameters">
        <t>There may be a need to change the parameters of an already
        established and configured OAM function during the lifetime of
        the LSP. To do so the LSP needs to be re-signaled with the
        updated parameters. OAM parameters influence the content and
        timing of OAM messages and identify the way OAM defects and
        alarms are derived and generated. Hence, to avoid spurious
        alarms, it is important that both sides, OAM sink and source,
        are updated in a synchronized way. First, the alarms of the
        OAM sink function should be suppressed and only then should
        expected OAM parameters be adjusted. Subsequently, the
        parameters of the OAM source function can be updated. Finally,
        the alarms of the OAM sink side can be enabled again.</t>

        <!--It occurs to me that during the alarms suppresion stage there shuold be a timer that can be enabled if the
 operation is not intened to take too long.-->

        <t>In accordance with the above operation, the LSP MUST first
        be re-signaled with "OAM Alarms Enabled" ADMIN_STATUS flag
        cleared, including the updated OAM Configuration TLV
        corresponding to the new parameter settings. The initiator
        MUST keep its OAM sink and source functions running
        unmodified, but it MUST suppress OAM alarms after the updated
        Path message is sent. The receiver MUST first disable all OAM
        alarms, then update the OAM parameters according to the
        information in the Path message and reply with a Resv message
        acknowledging the changes by including the OAM Configuration
        TLV. Note that the receiving side has the possibility to
        adjust the requested OAM configuration parameters and reply
        with an updated OAM Configuration TLV in the Resv message,
        reflecting the actually configured values. However, in order
        to avoid an extensive negotiation phase, in the case of
        adjusting already configured OAM functions, the receiving side
        SHOULD NOT update the parameters requested in the Path message
        to an extent that would provide lower performance (e.g., lower
        frequency of monitoring packets) than what has been in
        operation previously. <!--This does not quite hang together.
        I would suggest that one reason for suppressing alarms is jsut
        a period where the current configuration would alarm. So a
        "dont alarm for 10 seconds" woudl be a valuable message. On
        negotiation the recivere shoud match teh request unless the
        value is not supported (for example 10ms CCMs not
        suported). In the case of adjusting to parameter that are not
        avialble no change should take place but the closest possible
        values shoudl be returned so a source could attemt and
        acceptable change.  --></t>

        <t>The initiator MUST only update its OAM sink and source functions
        after it received the Resv message. After this Path/Resv message
        exchange (in both unidirectional and bidirectional LSP cases) the OAM
        parameters are updated and OAM is running according the new parameter
        settings. However, OAM alarms are still disabled. A subsequent
        Path/Resv message exchange with "OAM Alarms Enabled" ADMIN_STATUS flag
        set is needed to enable OAM alarms again.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deleting OAM Entities">
        <t>In some cases it may be useful to remove some or all OAM
        entities and functions from an LSP without actually tearing
        down the connection.<!--Some OAM such as BFD has the ability
        to change rates on the fly. --></t>

        <t>To avoid any spurious alarms, first the LSP MUST be
        re-signaled with "OAM Alarms Enabled" ADMIN_STATUS flag
        cleared but unchanged OAM configuration. Subsequently, the LSP
        is re-signaled with "OAM MEP Entities desired" and "OAM MIP
        Entities desired" LSP ATTRIBUTES flags cleared, and without
        the OAM Configuration TLV, this MUST result in the deletion of
        all OAM entities associated with the LSP. All control and data
        plane resources in use by the OAM entities and functions
        SHOULD be freed up. Alternatively, if only some OAM functions
        need to be removed, the LSP is re-signaled with the updated
        OAM Configuration TLV. Changes between the contents of the
        previously signaled OAM Configuration TLV and the currently
        received TLV represent which functions MUST be
        removed/added.</t>

        <t>OAM source functions MUST be deleted first and only after
        the "OAM Alarms Disabled" can the associated OAM sink
        functions be removed, this will ensure that OAM messages do
        not leak outside the LSP. To this end the initiator, before
        sending the Path message, MUST remove the OAM source, hence
        terminating the OAM message flow associated to the downstream
        direction. In the case of a bidirectional connection, it MUST
        leave in place the OAM sink functions associated to the
        upstream direction. The remote end, after receiving the Path
        message, MUST remove all associated OAM entities and functions
        and reply with a Resv message without an OAM Configuration
        TLV. The initiator completely removes OAM entities and
        functions after the Resv message arrived.</t>

    <t>RFC Editor Note: remove/update "IANA" and "IANA to
    assign" notes in the document once the assignments have been
    made.</t>

      <section title="LSP Attributes Flags">
        <t>In RSVP-TE the Flags field of the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object
        is used to indicate options and attributes of the LSP. The
        Flags field has 8 bits and hence is limited to differentiate
        only 8 options. <xref target="RFC5420"/> defines new objects
        for RSVP-TE messages to allow the signaling of arbitrary
        attribute parameters making RSVP-TE easily extensible to
        support new applications. Furthermore, <xref
        target="RFC5420"/> allows options and attributes that do not
        need to be acted on by all Label Switched Routers (LSRs) along
        the path of the LSP. In particular, these options and
        attributes may apply only to key LSRs on the path such as the
        ingress LSR and egress LSR. Options and attributes can be
        signaled transparently, and only examined at those points that
        need to act on them. The LSP_ATTRIBUTES and the
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects are defined in <xref
        target="RFC5420"/> to provide means to signal LSP attributes
        and options in the form of TLVs. Options and attributes
        signaled in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object can be passed
        transparently through LSRs not supporting a particular option
        or attribute, while the contents of the
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object MUST be examined and processed
        by each LSR. One TLV is defined in <xref target="RFC5420"/>:
        the Attributes Flags TLV.</t>

        <t>One bit (IANA to assign): "OAM MEP entities desired" is allocated
        in the LSP Attributes Flags TLV to be used in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
        object. If the "OAM MEP entities desired" bit is set it is indicating
        that the establishment of OAM MEP entities are required at the
        endpoints of the signaled LSP. If the establishment of MEPs is not
        supported an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/MEP establishment
        not supported".</t>

        <t>If the "OAM MEP entities desired" bit is set and additional
        parameters need to be configured, an OAM Configuration TLV MAY be
        included in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.</t>

        <t>One bit (IANA to assign): "OAM MIP entities desired" is
        allocated in the LSP Attributes Flags TLV to be used in the
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUES objects.  If the "OAM
        MEP entities desired" bit is not set then this bit MUST NOT be
        set.  If the "OAM MIP entities desired" bit is set in the
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES Flags TLV in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
        Object, it is indicating that the establishment of OAM MIP
        entities is required at every transit node of the signaled
        LSP. If the establishment of a MIP is not supported an error
        MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/MIP establishment not
        supported". If an intermediate LSR does not support the
        extensions defined in this document it will not recognize the
        "OAM MIP entities desired" flag and although the
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object was used it will not configure
        MIP entities and will not raise any errors. If LSRs that are
        not supporting this document are to be assumed in the network,
        the ingress LSR SHOULD collect per-hop information about the
        LSP Attributes utilizing the LSP Attributes sub-object of the
        Record Route Object as defined in <xref
        target="RFC5420"/>. When the Record Route object is received
        the ingress SHOULD check whether all intermediate LSRs set the
        "OAM MIP entities desired" flag indicating support of the
        function, if not, depending on operator policy the LSP MAY
        need to be torn down. </t>

        the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object in Path and Resv
        messages. When carried in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object, it is

        code.</t>

        <t>If a node does not support the establishment of OAM MEP or MIP
        entities it MUST use the error value: "MEP establishment not

        included than what was specified in the OAM Type an error MUST be
        generated with error value: "OAM Type Mismatch" in the PathErr

      <section title="Considerations on Point-to-Multipoint OAM Configuration">
        <t>RSVP-TE extensions for the establishment of point-to-multipoint
        (P2MP) LSPs are specified in <xref target="RFC4875"/>. A P2MP LSP is
        comprised of multiple source-to-leaf (S2L) sub-LSPs. These S2L
        sub-LSPs are set up between the ingress and egress LSRs, and are
        appropriately combined by the branch LSRs using RSVP semantics to
        result in a P2MP TE LSP. One Path message may signal one or multiple
        S2L sub-LSPs for a single P2MP LSP. Hence, the S2L sub-LSPs belonging
        to a P2MP LSP can be signaled using one Path message or split across
        multiple Path messages.</t>

        <t>P2MP OAM mechanisms are very specific to the data plane
        technology, therefore in this document, we only highlight the
        basic principles of P2MP OAM configuration. We consider only
        the root to leaf OAM flows, and as such, aspects of the
        configuration of return paths are outside the scope of our
        discussions. We also limit our consideration to the case where
        all leaves must successfully establish OAM entities with
        identical configuration in order the P2MP OAM is successfully
        established. In any case, the discussion set forth below
        provides only guidelines for P2MP OAM configuration. However
        at minimum the below procedures SHOULD be specified for P2MP
        OAM configuration in a technology specific document.</t>

        <t>The root node may use a single Path message or multiple Path
        messages to setup the whole P2MP tree. In the case when multiple Path
        messages are used, the root node is responsible to keep the OAM
        Configuration information consistent in each of the sent Path
        messages, i.e., the same information MUST be included in all Path
        messages used to construct the multicast tree. Each branching node
        will propagate the Path message downstream on each of the branches,
        when constructing a Path message the OAM Configuration information
        MUST be copied unchanged from the received Path message, including the
        related ADMIN_STATUS bits, LSP Attribute Flags and the OAM
        Configuration TLV. The latter two also imply that the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
        and LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object MUST be copied for the upstream
        Path message to the subsequent downstream Path messages.</t>

        <t>Leaves MUST create and configure OAM sink functions according to
        the parameters received in the Path message, for P2MP OAM
        configuration there is no possibility for parameter negotiation on a
        per leaf basis. This is due to the fact that the OAM source function,
        residing in the root of the tree, will operate with a single
        configuration, which then must be obeyed by all leaves. If a leaf
        cannot accept the OAM parameters it MUST use the RRO Attributes
        sub-object <xref target="RFC5420"/> to notify the root about the
        problem. In particular, if the OAM configuration was successful, the
        leaf would set the "OAM MEP entities desired" flag in the RRO
        Attributes sub-object in the Resv message. On the other hand, if OAM
        entities could not be established the Resv message should be sent with
        the "OAM MEP entities desired" bit cleared in the RRO Attributes
        sub-object. Branching nodes should collect and merge the received RROs
        according to the procedures described in <xref target="RFC4875"/>.
        This way, the root when receiving the Resv message (or messages if
        multiple Path messages were used to set up the tree) will have a clear
        information about which of the leaves could establish the OAM
        functions. If all leaves established OAM entities successfully, the
        root can enable the OAM message flow. On the other hand, if at some
        leaves the establishment was unsuccessful additional actions will be
        needed before the OAM message flow can be enabled. Such action could
        be to setup two independent P2MP LSPs. One LSP with OAM Configuration
        information towards leaves which could successfully setup the OAM
        function. This can be done by pruning the leaves which failed to setup
        OAM of the previously signaled P2MP LSP. The other P2MP LSP could be
        constructed for leaves without OAM entities. The exact procedures
        will be described in technology specific documents.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The signaling of OAM related parameters and the automatic
      establishment of OAM entities based on RSVP-TE messages adds a new
      aspect to the security considerations discussed in <xref
      target="RFC3473"/>. In particular, a network element could be
      overloaded, if a remote attacker could request liveliness monitoring,
      with frequent periodic messages, for a high number of LSPs, targeting a
      single network element. Such an attack can efficiently be prevented when
      mechanisms for message integrity and node authentication are deployed.
      Since the OAM configuration extensions rely on the hop-by-hop exchange
      of exiting RSVP-TE messages, procedures specified for RSVP message
      security in <xref target="RFC2747"/> can be used to mitigate possible
      attacks.</t>

      <t>For a more comprehensive discussion of GMPLS security, and
      attack mitigation techniques, please see the Security Framework
      for MPLS and GMPLS Networks <xref target="RFC5920"/>.</t>
