    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>To meet user demand, operators and service providers continue to
      deploy multicast applications using the Multicast Label Distribtion
      Protocol (Multicast LDP - mLDP) across MPLS networks. For real-time
      applications, such as stock trading, on-line games, and multimedia
      teleconferencing, traditional node protection mechanisms (such as
      IGP-mLDP convergence based mechanisms<cref>EBD: This needs a reference
      or an explanation - I am unsure what this mechanism is.</cref>) fail to
      achieve a protection switching time less than that which is required to
      minimize the interruption of applications.</t>

      <t>Instead of relying on IGP-mLDP re-convergence <cref source="">EBD: I
      *think* this is what was meant </cref> for failure protection,
      pre-computing and establishing a backup path before the failure delivers
      a better solution, allowing a more rapid switch over to the backup path
      when the protected node fails .</t>

      <t>Providing a pre-computed backup path requires solutions to two
      complex problems:<list style="symbols">
          <t>how to compute a completely disjoint backup path for each node in
          a multicast tree, and</t>

          <t>how to signal and setup the computed backup path.</t>
        </list>.For a primary Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Path
      (LSP) created by LDP, there are several methods that could be chosen for
      creating a backup path:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The use of an RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol - RSVP -
          Traffic Engineering) point-to-point (P2P) tunnel as a logical
          out-going interface, which consequently utilizes the mature
          high-availability technology of RSVP-TE.</t>

          <t>The use of an alternative LDP P2P LSP as a packet encapsulation,
          which avoids the complex configuration of P2P RSVP-TE.</t>

          <t>Creating a P2MP backup LSP using a loop-free alternative route
          provided by the IGP.</t>

          <t>Using multi-topology technology, wherein the backup topology can
          be either statically configured or dynamically computed and signaled
          using IP/LDP Fast-Reroute mechanisms <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>When the backup path is available, there are two options for packet
      forwarding and protection switchover:</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="10" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Option 1">The traffic sender transmits the stream on
          both the primary and backup path. Once the local traffic receiver
          detects a failure, the switchover will be relatively fast. However,
          the disadvantage of this method is that it consumes bandwidth
          because duplicate traffic will be sent on the primary and backup
          paths.</t>

          <t hangText="Option 2">The traffic sender transmits only on the
          primary path. Although bandwidth resource usage is minimized,
          cooperation is required to provide adequate switching times and to
          minimize higher-layer and application impact.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Ideally, if the switching time performance can be equal to or better
      than that of Option 1, it is reasonable to choose Option 2 to avoid
      bandwidth wastage. This consideration has been taken into account in
      making the recommendations in this document.</t>

      <t>Note that the computation and configuration of the primary topology
      and backup topology are out of the scope of this draft. The algorithm
      can be Loop-free Alternate (LFA) based<cref>EBD: Does this need a ref to
      RFC5286</cref>, Maximally Redundant Tree (MRT) based <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"></xref> , or based off of
      any other algorithms/method available including the static and offline
      tools. In addition, detecting failure is also outside the scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>Compared to a P2P LSP based solution (as specified in the mLDP Node
      Protection procedutes <xref
      target="I-D.wijnands-mpls-mldp-node-protection"></xref>), this P2MP LSP
      based solution not only uses mLDP mechanisms for both the primary path
      and backup paths, but also avoids unnecessary packet duplication.</t>

      <t>The remainder of this document specifies the signalling procedures
      and protocol extensions for the P2MP LSP based mLDP node protection
      solution which was briefly introduced above.</t>

      <section title="Requirements">
        <t>A number of requirements have been identified that allow the
        optimal set of mechanisms to develop. These currently include:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Computation of a disjointed (link and node) backup path within
            the multicast tree</t>

            <t>Minimization of protection convergence time</t>

            <t>Minimization of operation and maintenance cost</t>

            <t>Optimization of bandwidth usage</t>

            <t>More protect scenario coverage</t>
          </list></t>

      <section title="Scope">
        <t>The method to detect failure is outside the scope of this
        document.</t>

        <t>The protections of leaf and root nodes are also outside the scope
        of this document.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="mLDP Node Protection Example">
      <t>By using IGP-FRR or Multi Topology Routing (including the MRT MT
      routing), LDP can build the backup mLDP LSP among PLR, Pn, and MPs (the
      downstream nodes of the protected node). In the case of a large number
      of downstream nodes, this mechanism can avoid unnecessary packet
      duplication between PLR and the merge points.</t>

      <t>In Figure 1, R2 is on the preferential path from R4/5 to R1, and the
      secondary path is through R3. In this case, the mLDP LSP will be
      established according to the IGP preferential path as R1--R2--R4/R5. As
      an example, this figure takes R2 as the Protected Node though the
      Protected Node can be any Transit node of the mLDP LSP. (We assume that
      all the nodes in Figure 1 support this mLDP based node protection
      method, including Pn.)</t>

      <t>The procedure of P2MP Based mLDP Node Protection is as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>As the Protected Node, R2 should announce its selected upstream
          node R1 to all its downstream nodes, which are R4 and R5 in this
          example. The node to protect can then be decided by local
          configuration or by its role(transit) in the mLDP LSP.</t>

          <t>R4 and R5 can consider R1 as the root node of the backup mLDP LSP
          and can trigger the backup LSP signaling. In parallel, R4/R5 will
          bind the primary NHLFE(s) to both the backup and primary ILM
          entries, so that the traffic from the backup mLDP LSP can be merged
          locally to the primary LSP.</t>

          <t>PLR can distinguish primary LSP and backup LSP by the signaling
          procedure and can feed traffic on the primary path before failure.
          When R2 node fails, R1 quickly switches the traffic to the preset
          backup path.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In this scenario, if R2 is protected by two P2P LSPs as R1--R3--R4
      and R1--R3--R5 (similar to the method in the draft of
      I-D.wijnands-mpls-mldp-node-protection), the traffic will be duplicated
      on R1, and R3 will receive two streams. But, if R2 is protected by a
      mLDP LSP instead, R3 will only receive one stream, and thus there will
      be no packet duplication on R3.</t>

    <section title="Signaling Procedures for P2MP Based Node Protection">
      <t>This section introduces the signaling procedures of P2MP LSP's node
      protection using P2MP-based backup LSP.</t>

      <section title="The Computation of the Backup Path">
        <t>Obviously, the backup path can not go through the protected node N.
        This section discusses how to choose the backup upstream LSR to avoid
        N.</t>

        <t>Firstly, find the candidate upstream LSRs as below:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>MPs should preferentially choose the upstream LSRs on the
            shortest path as candidates, except node N. If no other upstream
            LSRs are on the shortest path, MPs should choose the next-hop on
            N's detour path as a candidate. The detour path can be an IGP-FRR
            path or other topology-based disjoint paths. The IGP-FRR path can
            be provided by LFA, U-Turn, etc. The disjoint path can be provided
            by MT, MRT (see details in the next section), etc. Choosing the
            candidates is a local decision and can be determined by
            configuration.</t>

            <t>The Pn node MUST be chosen from the IGP next-hops on the
            shortest path toward PLR within the topology specified in the FRR
            mLDP FEC element by MT-ID field. The candidate upstream LSRs MUST
            not be the node N.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Thus, each node can choose one upstream node from the candidate
        upstream LSRs as its backup upstream LSR via the algorithm described
        in [RFC6388] section 2.4.1.1.</t>
      </section>

      <section title=" The Procedures for Merge Point, Protected Node, Pn Node and PLR Node">
        <t>[Editors Note - The procedures for P2MP Based Node Protection
        described in this document assumes the PLR is capable of node failure
        detection.]</t>

        <t>We assume all the involved nodes have advertised their
        corresponding protection capabilities. And the following section
        specifies the signaling procedures of P2MP Based Node Protection.</t>

        <section title="Merge Point's Procedures ">
          <t>Each non-Ingress LSR determines its own upstream LSR and sends
          out a label mapping message, in accordance with the procedures
          documented in <xref target="RFC6388"></xref> without any additional
          extension. And its upstream LSR will propagate a new label mapping
          message to its upstream LSR. In such cases, the non-Ingress LSR is
          the MP node (as R4, R5 in Figure 1), MP's upstream LSR is the
          protected node (as R2 in Figure 1), and the protected node's
          upstream node is PLR (as R1 in Figure 1).</t>

          <t>When one MP (as R4/R5 nodes in figure 1) receives the
          Notification, it individually determines its secondary path toward
          the PLR according to the IGP routes. The algorithms for
          choosing/computing the backup path can be LFA, MRT or others. After
          the backup upstream LSR is chosen, MP will send out a FRR Label
          mapping message, which includes the mLDP backup tree's key &lt;PLR,
          protected-node, original-mLDP-FEC&gt; and the MT-ID if the backup
          path is not in the default topology. Note that the label assigned
          for the primary path and the secondary path MUST be different to
          avoid having the MP feed primary traffic to its secondary path's
          downstream LSRs. In addition, the original-mLDP-FEC of the backup
          tree key is encoded in a special opaque value as introduced in
          section 4.2.3.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Protected Node's Procedures ">
          <t>After the Protected Node (as R2 in Figure 1 ) determines its
          upstream LSR (as R1 in figure 1), it will send the information
          (PLR's indentify, mLDP FEC) via Notification messages to all its
          downstream nodes(MPs) immediately. If other LSRs become its
          downstream nodes later, it will send such announcements to its new
          MP(s).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Pn Node's Procedures">
          <t>When one node receives such aforementioned FRR label mapping
          messages, if it is not the PLR, it can consider itself a Pn node and
          will choose its backup upstream node toward PLR on the corresponding
          topology's shortest IGP path. To avoid the backup LSP going through
          the Protected Node, additional path selection rule(s) should be
          applied. A simple method is for the transit nodes to not choose the
          specified Protected Node as its upstream LSR for the backup LSP.
          Other methods, such as the not-via policy, are under study and will
          be added in the future. To make the primary and backup topologies
          rooted from PLR satisfy the 'maximum disjointed' requirement, they
          can either be configured through static configurations or be
          signaled dynamically through other mechanisms such as MRT.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="PLR Node's Procdures ">
          <t>When PLR(R1) receives the FRR label mapping message, it can
          identify that it is the PLR by the mLDP backup FEC elements. Thus,
          it will decode the special opaque value (which contains the primary
          mLDP FEC element, introduced in section 4.2.3) and generate the
          backup forwarding entry for the specific LSP, which is identified by
          the root address and opaque value in the special opaque value. It
          will also bind the backup forwarding state to the specific primary
          entry, which is indicated by the Protected Node address in the
          message. Note that there might be more than one backup forwarding
          entry for a specific protected node.</t>

          <t>When failure is detected by PLR, it will switch the traffic to
          the backup paths. MP will also locally choose which traffic to
          recieve and merge this traffic back to the primary LSP. The
          switchover manner on PLR is specified in detail in the later section
          of this document.</t>

      <section title="PLR Switching Over Considerations">
        <t>This section provides two methods for Switchover when failure
        occurs:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="10" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Option 1:">If PLR cannot differentiate link and node
            failure, MP must take the responsibility to drop one of the two
            duplicate traffics when failure is detected. In this case, the
            Node Failure Required Flag (in the P2MP Based MP Node Protection
            Status Element) must be set as 'N'. PLR will switch the traffic to
            the backup path when failure is detected, and MP will drop traffic
            on the backup path until it sees N fail.</t>

            <t hangText="Option 2:">If PLR can differentiate link and node
            failure, PLR MUST NOT switch the traffic to the backup path until
            it detects the node N's failure. In this case, the Node Failure
            Required Flag, in the P2MP Based MP Node Protection Status
            Element, must be set as 'Y'.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Procedures after the Reconvergence">
        <t>When Merge Point(s) see the next hop to Root changed, it/they will
        advertise the new mapping message(s), and the traffic will re-
        converge to the new primary path. MP will then withdraw the backup
        label after the re-convergence. Pn will delete the specified backup
        LSP just as in the procedure of deleting normal P2MP LSP. And the
        entire backup P2MP LSP will be deleted when the node MP leaves the
        backup P2MP LSP.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Considerations for MP2MP LSP Node Protection">
        <t>When a MP2MP LSP node needs to be protected, it can be treated with
        the same p2mp LSP node protection procedures for each forwarding
        direction.</t>

        <section title="MP Node Procedure">
          <t>MP sends a backup label mapping message containing MP2MP
          downstream FRR FEC elements. When PLR receives a backup label

          label mapping message with mp2mp upstream FRR FEC elements to Pn and
          then finally to MPs. This procedure just follows the normal MP2MP
          LSP procedure.</t>

          downstream NHLFE entry to backup MP2MP downstream ILM entry and
          binds its backup MP2MP upstream NHLFE entry to primary MP2MP
          upstream ILM entry.</t>

          <t>For the forwarding entries, MP node binds its primary MP2MP
          downstream NHLFE entry to backup MP2MP downstream ILM entry and
          binds its backup MP2MP upstream NHLFE entry to primary MP2MP
          upstream ILM entry.</t>

          <t>PLR node binds its backup MP2MP downstream NHLFE entry to primary
          MP2MP downstream ILM entry and binds its primary MP2MP upstream
          NHLFE entry to backup MP2MP upstream ILM entry.</t>

        <section title="Switchover Procedure">
