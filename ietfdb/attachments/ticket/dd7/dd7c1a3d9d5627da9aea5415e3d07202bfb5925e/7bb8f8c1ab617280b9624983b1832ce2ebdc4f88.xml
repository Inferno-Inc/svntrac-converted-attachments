    <section title="Introduction">

        <t>
        <xref target="RFC7001"/> specifies the Authentication-Results header field for conveying results
        of message authentication checks.
        As S/MIME signature verification (and alteration) is sometimes implemented in
        border message transfer agents, guards and gateways (for example see <xref target="RFC3183"/>),
        there is a need to convey signature verification status to Mail User Agents (MUA)
        and downstream filters.
        This document defines a new authentication method to be used in the Authentication-Results
        header field for S/MIME related signature checks.

    <c>neutral</c><c>
      The message was signed but the signature or signatures

      covered elsewhere in this list.

    <c>temperror</c><c>
      The message could not be verified due to some error that
      is likely transient in nature, such as a temporary inability to
      retrieve a certificate or CRL.  A later attempt may produce a final
      result.
    </c>

    <c>permerror</c><c>
      The message could not be verified due to some error that
      is unrecoverable, such as a required header field being absent
      or the signer's certificate not being available.
      A later attempt is unlikely to produce a final result.
    </c>
      </texttable>


      <t>
      A signature is "acceptable to the verifier" if it passes local policy
      checks (or there are no specific local policy checks). For example,
      a verifier might require that the domain in the rfc822Name subjectAltName
      in the signing certificate matches the domain in the address of the
      sender of the message (value of the Sender header field, if present. Value of the From header field otherwise),
      thus making third-party signatures unacceptable.
<!--////Is this actually true?-->      
      <xref target="RFC5751"/> advises that if a message fails verification, it should be
      treated as an unsigned message.  A report of "fail" here permits the
      receiver of the report to decide how to handle the failure.  A report
      of "neutral" or "none" preempts that choice, ensuring the message
      will be treated as if it had not been signed.

I would also point out that there is no requirement in RFC 5750 for the certificate
relating to the signing key to contain an email address. It SHOULD, but
receiving agents MUST be able to handle one without. RFC 5750 says that
the receiving agent should compare the address associated with the certificate
(if any) with the From or Sender address, and SHOULD provide some alternate processing
if there is no match. Note this is for the address, not just the domain part
of the address. It does not specify a different action should there be NO associated
email address.

Note that this affects your 'sime-identifier' field. The unique identity of the
signer is given by the issuer of the certificate and its serial number - although
these are not very helpful :-).

<t>
  Either both or neither of body.smime-serial and
  body.smime-issuer should be present in an
  Authentication-Results header field.  body.smime-serial and
  body.smime-issuer are used for cases when
  body.smime-identifier (email address) can't be derived by the
  entity adding the corresponding Authentication-Results header
  field. For example this can be used when gatewaying from
  X.400.

          body.smime-part contains the MIME body part reference which contains the S/MIME signature.
          Syntax of this property is described by the smime-part ABNF production below.
          application/pkcs7-signature or application/pkcs7-mime (containing SignedData) media type body parts
          are references using the &lt;section&gt; syntax (see Section 6.4.5 of <xref target="RFC3501"/>).
          <!--////Add an example?-->
          If the signature being verified is encapsulated by another CMS content type
          (e.g. application/pkcs7-mime containing EnvelopedData, which contains SignedData),
          such inner signature body part can be references using &quot;section[/section...&quot; syntax.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="seccons">

      <t>This document doesn't add new security considerations not already covered by
      <xref target="RFC7001"/> and <xref target="RFC5751"/>.
      In particular security considerations related to use of weak cryptography over plaintext,
      weakening and breaking of cryptographic algorithms over time, as well
      as changing the behavior of message processing based on presence of a signature
      specified in <xref target="RFC5751"/> are relevant to this document.
      Similarly, the following security considerations specified in <xref target="RFC7001"/>
      are particularly relevant to this document: Forged Header Fields, Misleading Results,
      Internal MTA Lists and Compromised Internal Hosts.
      </t>

      <t>To repeat something already mentioned in RFC 7001, Section 7.1:
      
      <list style="empty">
        <t>
          An MUA or filter that accesses a mailbox whose messages are handled
          by a non-conformant MTA, and understands Authentication-Results
          header fields, could potentially make false conclusions based on
          forged header fields.  A malicious user or agent could forge a header
          field using the DNS domain of a receiving ADMD as the authserv-id
          token in the value of the header field and, with the rest of the
          value, claim that the message was properly authenticated.  The non-
          conformant MTA would fail to strip the forged header field, and the
          MUA could inappropriately trust it.
        </t>

        <t>
          For this reason, it is best not to have processing of the
          Authentication-Results header field enabled by default; instead, it
          should be ignored, at least for the purposes of enacting filtering
          decisions, unless specifically enabled by the user or administrator
          after verifying that the border MTA is compliant.  It is acceptable
          to have an MUA aware of this specification but have an explicit list
          of hostnames whose Authentication-Results header fields are
          trustworthy; however, this list should initially be empty.
        </t>
      </list>
      
      So to emphasize this point: whenever possible, MUAs should implement their own
      S/MIME signature verification instead of implementing this specification.
      </t>

      <t>
      Note that agents adding Authentication-Results header fields
      containing S/MIME Authentication Method might be unable to verify<vspace blankLines='0'/>
      S/MIME signatures inside encrypted CMS content types such as
      EnvelopedData <xref target="RFC5652"/>.
      So agents processing Authentication-Results header fields can't treat lack of an Authentication-Results
      header field with S/MIME Authentication Method as an indication that the corresponding
      S/MIME signature is missing, invalid or valid.
