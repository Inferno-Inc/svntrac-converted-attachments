      <t>Firewalls, packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and the like
often have difficulty distinguishing between packets that have
malicious intent and those that are merely unusual.  We define a
security flag in the IPv4 header as a means of distinguishing the two
cases.</t>

      <t>Firewalls <xref target="CBR03"/>, packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and
the like often have difficulty distinguishing between packets that
have malicious intent and those that are merely unusual.  The problem
is that making such determinations is hard.  To solve this problem,
we define a security flag, known as the "evil" bit, in the IPv4
<xref target="RFC0791"/> header.  Benign packets have this bit set to 0; those that
are used for an attack will have the bit set to 1.</t>

      <t>The high-order bit of the IP fragment offset field is the only unused
bit in the IP header.  Accordingly, the selection of the bit position
is not left to IANA.</t>
      <t>The bit field is laid out as follows:</t>
