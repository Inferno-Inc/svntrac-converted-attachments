      <t>The "Historical" category has been used to identify some
		 documents in the RFC Series for many years, but has never
		 been precisely defined except in various oral traditions.
		 More important, with one exception that is now obsolete, the
		 conditions under which documents should be reclassified as
		 Historic and the procedures for doing so have never been
		 defined, leading to a number of ad hoc and inconsistent
		 actions.  This document clarifies both the category and
		 procedures for putting documents into it.</t>
    </abstract>
	
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction and History">
      <t>The "Historical" category for RFCs was mentioned in the
		 RFC Series as early as December 1988
		 <xref target="RFC1083"/> where the description said "[t]hese
		 are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards in
		 the Internet either because they have been superseded by
		 later developments or due to lack of interest.  These are
		 protocols that are at an evolutionary dead end."    
		 The category was most recently specified in Section 4.2.4 of the
		 Internet Standards Process definition
		 <xref target="RFC2026"/>.  However, the specification there
		 says only "has been superseded by a more recent
		 specification or is for any other reason considered to be
		 obsolete is assigned to the "Historic" level".  With one
		 exception, it does not specify what entity makes that
		 assignment, how it is done, and when it is actually
		 appropriate.  The exception is the provision for automatic
		 reclassification of standards track documents that have not
		 advanced in Section 6.2 of the Standards Process definition,
		 a provision that was
		 eliminated in 2013 <xref target="RFC6410"/>.  It is worth
		 noting, for example, the neither the RFC Editor nor the
		 IESG routinely moved earlier documents to Historic when later
		 ones where published that superseded ("obsoleted") except in
		 the case where the replacement documents explicitly specified that
		 action.
	  </t>
	  <t> This specification elaborates on the Historic category (or
		 "level") and defines conditions and mechanisms for placing
		 documents in it.</t> 
      <t>While this is not a protocol specification in the usual sense,
		 the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted for the actions and options it
	  specifies as described in
	  <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

	<section title="A Typology of Documents that have been Placed in the Historic Category">
	   <t>Part of the long-term difficulty with the Historic category
		  is that its past use was applied to documents of many different
		  types.  The people who made use of it had different purposes
		  in mind when they applied it.
		  This section categorizes those situations to provide a
		  proper background.</t> 

	   <section title="Obsoleted by Another Document" anchor="obsoleted">
		  <t>This is the one category that appears to be explicitly
		  called out by the IETF Standards
		  Process <xref target="RFC2026"/>.  Documents in this
		  category are associated with
		  a subsequent RFC that contains similar or replacement
		  content and which explicitly identifies the earlier, now
		  obsolete, "Historic" candidate in an "Obsoletes" header.
		  RFC 1145 <xref target="RFC1145"/> is an example of a
		  document in this category.</t> 
	   </section>
	   <section title="Published but Ignored"
			   anchor="NoTraction"> 
		  <t>Documents fall into this category if they were published
			 but were never implemented or deployed and there is no
			 evidence that anyone expects them to be implemented or
			 deployed in the future.
		     RFC 1421 <xref target="RFC1421"/> is an example of
			 documents in this category.</t> 
	   </section>
	   <section title="Documents that are no longer relevant to the Internet"
			   anchor="irrelevant"> 
		  <t>These are specifications that may have been important at
			 one time but that are believed to no longer be in use and
			 to have no future utility.  Protocol specifications that
			 became irrelevant after the transition from the ARPANET
			 to the Internet would fall into this category.
		     RFC 1240 <xref target="RFC1240"/> is an example of a
			 document in this category and
			 RFC 2556 <xref target="RFC2556"/>  is an example of a
			 document reclassifying a RFC to Historic for this
			 reason.</t> 
	   </section>
	   <section title="Specifications published purely for historical value"
			   anchor="historicSpec"> 
		  <t>Occasionally a document will be published in the RFC
			 series simply to record something for historical value.
			 These documents may be identified by their authors as
			 Historic at the time of first publication.

			 documents in this category.</t> 
	   </section>
	   <section title="Specifications that are believed to be undesirable or dangerous in some way"
			   anchor="deprecated"> 
		  <t>Occasionally, a specification may be published that is
			 later found to be undesirable, less attractive than some
			 alternative, or dangerous or harmful in some way.
			 These
			 specifications SHOULD normally be formally assigned a
			 status of "Not Recommended" (see Section 3.3(e) of RFC
			 2026) and MAY be identified as Historic when that is
			 appropriate for other reasons.

	 </section>

	 <section title="Procedures for classification as Historic">
		<t>There are three main models for identification of a
		   document as Historic, with applicability based on the
		   categories above.  </t>

		<section title="Administrative Action by the RFC Editor and Stream Authority">
		   <t>When a document is published as
			  Historic (<xref target="historicSpec"/> above), has been
			  explicitly obsoleted by
			  another document (<xref target="obsoleted"/>), or
			  describes protocols to other topics that are obviously
			  of no further use to, or on, the
			  Internet (<xref target="NoTraction"/>).  Documents in
			  these categories MAY be classified as Historic by the
			  RFC Editor with the advice and consent of the relevant
			  Stream if one exists.  ARPANET-specific documents
			  that, as of the time of this writing, have had a status
			  of "UNKNOWN" for many years MAY be reclassified to
			  Historic by the RFC Editor if a determination is made
			  that they are not referenced by active documents in
			  other categories.   The RFC Editor and/or the relevant
			  stream authority are encouraged to consult relevant
			  communities before classifying a document as Historic
			  using this method, but are not required to do so.</t> 
		</section>
		<section title="Formal Action by the Responsible Stream Authority">
		   <t> Where the conditions above do not apply but a document
			  appears to cover a specification or description that is
			  no longer in use, a stream MAY verify the absence of
			  implementations or deployment by its usual procedures
			  for obtaining consensus from its community to reclassify
			  the document.  If there is doubt about that consensus or
			  there appear to be a strong possibility that the
			  specification has been implemented and deployed, the
			  next procedure SHOULD be used.  The stream MUST document
			  the decision in some stable and permanent way according
			  to procedures of its choice.  The RFC Editor is
			  responsible for assuring that documentation is readily
			  identified and available to anyone looking for
			  information about the relevant RFC(s).</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Approval and Publication of a new RFC that explicitly recategorizes one or more RFCs.">
		   <t> This procedure applies when neither of the above
			  procedures is applicable and, 
			  in particular, when there is reason to believe that the
			  specification or information in the RFC has been
			  implemented, deployed, and that it may still be in use
			  on the Internet or some network that might leak into it.
			  It is also appropriate if the move to Historic is
			  intended to formally deprecate a specification rather
			  than simply record the fact that it is obsolete.
			  For these cases, the stream is expected to prepare a
			  document that describes the reasons for the status change and
			  approve it for RFC publication using the stream's normal
			  procedures.  That RFC should explicitly note that it
			  obsoletes the earlier document; the request to move that
			  earlier document to Historic may be part of the RFC or
			  communicated separately.  The RFC may be an Applicability
			  Statement (most appropriate if the previous document was
			  Standards Track) or an Informational one that describes
			  the outcome of an earlier experiment or that documents
			  operational experience or a new understanding of the
			  implications of the prior specification or information. 
		   </t>
		</section>
     </section>

	 <section title="Documenting Status Changes">
		<t>Any change in the status of a RFC to Historic SHOULD be
		   documented in a way that informs readers as to the reason
		   for the change.  The documentation SHOULD be made easily
		   findable and remain accessible for as long as likely that
		   someone might want to refer to the RFC.</t>
		<t>In the case of the approval and publication of a new RFC
		   that explicitly recategorizes one or more RFCs the new RFC
		   serves as the documentation.  In other cases, the
		   existence and location of the documentation should be easy
		   to find from the normal way that people determine the
		   status of RFCs, for example, in the RFC index.</t>
	 </section>

	 <section title="Summary" anchor="tradeoffs">
		<t>A document may be moved to Historic for multiple reasons,
		   ranging from recognition that it is no longer in use,
		   useful, or
		   applicable to a desire to formally deprecate a
		   specification and warn the community against its use.  In
		   general, the former cases should be handled as an
		   administrative procedure: documented as appropriate but not
		   requiring an explanation in the RFC Series.  By contrast,
		   when a protocol that is in active use (even if only a few
		   places) is to be deprecated, that action and the reasons
		   for it should be documented in the RFC Series and should
		   receive the same levels of review and consensus as the
		   document it proposes to deprecate and make Historic.  The
		   principle is that, unless something was never implemented or
		   taken seriously or has become completely unused over time,
		   undoing its approval and any implicit recommendation (even
		   a recommendation for experimentation) should require the
		   same process of approval and publication as was needed to
		   approve it initially.   Anything else risks both confusing
		   readers of the RFC Series and questions about the fairness
		   of the actions taken.</t>

    <section anchor="Acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>This document was developed as an alternative to an appeal of
		 an IESG action that classified a specification that had been
		 implemented and deployed as Historic without 
		 documentation in the RFC series of the reasons for that
		 action.  The issues are discussed in more detail in
		 <xref target="tradeoffs"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.  It
		 is, however, important to check that any document being
		 proposed for Historic status neither contains the definitions
		 or, nor is referenced from, any IANA registry without
		 clarification of the status of the registry or registry
		 entry.  That clarification might require publication of an
		 RFC even if the category of the document itself does not, </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>While this specification should have no direct effect on
		 Internet Security, some of its provisions will have the
		 effect of getting specifications that are found to pose
		 security risks appropriate documented so as to warn the
		 community, rather than creating doubt about why the
		 specification was made Historic.</t>
