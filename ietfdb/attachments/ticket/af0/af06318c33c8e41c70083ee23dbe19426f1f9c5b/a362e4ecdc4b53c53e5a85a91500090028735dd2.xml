      <t>The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name

    <section title="Introduction">
	   <t><cref>RFC Editor: Please note that mentions of "RFC 3406bis"
		  in this I-D are defined as an Entity in the XML.  They
		  should be corrected to show the actual RFC number before
		  publication.</cref>
	   <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	   <cref>Note in draft: This document has been written in RFC
		  form, i.e., assuming that it and 3406bis have been approved.
		  That style of writing assumes that RFC 3406 and the rules it
		  specified are already obsolete.  It may be a bit awkward
		  while the I-D is being evaluated by the WG and the IETF, but
		  lowers the risk for errors or other  surprises during the
		  RFC editing process.</cref></t>

<t>
    As a part of the initial development of the URN system in the late 1990s,
    the IETF URN working group agreed that it was important to demonstrate
    that the URN syntax can accommodate existing identifier systems.
    <xref target="RFC2288"> RFC 2288 </xref> investigated the
    feasibility of using three identifiers (ISBN, ISSN and SICI)
    as URNs, with positive results;
    however, it did not formally register corresponding URN namespaces.
    This was in part due to the still evolving process to formalize
    criteria for namespace definition documents and registration,
    consolidated later in the IETF into successive Namespace
	Definition Mechanism documents 
    <xref target="RFC2611"/> <xref target="RFC3406"/>.
  </t>

  <t>
    URN Namespaces have subsequently been registered for
    NBN (National Bibliography Number) <xref target="RFC3188"/>,
    ISBN (International Standard Book Number) <xref target="RFC3187"/>,
    and ISSN (International Standard
	Serial Number) <xref target="RFC3044"/>.
   </t>

      <t>The predecessor registration procedure for Uniform Resource Name
		 (URN) namespaces <xref target="RFC3406"/>
         required IETF Consensus for formal ones.
         That requirement discouraged
		 some registrations and increased the risk for problems,
		 including use of names without registration ("squatting") that
		 could occur as a result.  Those potential problems included
		 the possibility of the same
		 name being used to identify different namespaces with
		 different rules.  The requirements have now been
		 changed <xref target="RFC3406bis"/> to adopt a different
		 model that focuses more on attempting to get all namespaces
		 that follow the syntax of formal ones registered, with as
		 much information collected as a possible consistent with that
		 goal.
		 This document specifies IANA instructions to adapt selected
		 existing registrations to the new model and obsoletes the
		 separate RFCs that specify the namespaces for
		 International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs) <xref target="RFC3044"/>,
		 International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) <xref target="RFC3187"/> 
		 to eliminate any ambiguity about the status of new
		 templates and updated registrations.</t>
	  <t> An updated version of the specification for 
		 the namespace for National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs)
		 <xref target="RFC3188"/> will be issued separately.  NBN is
		 not a formal international
		 standard and RFC 3188 is the only formal document which specifies its 
		 scope. The intention is to modernize the existing namespace 
		 registration so that it specifies the identifier and provides 
		 examples of its use, while the actual namespace registration will
		 be done according to the new practice. </t>

	  <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>  -->
    </section>

	<section title="Obsoleting Older Registration RFCs" anchor="NewTemplates">
	   <t>The existing RFCs that describe URN namespaces for
		  ISSNs (RFC 3044) and ISBNs (RFC 3187)
		 should be identified as "Historic" immediately after this
		 document is approved and the new
		 registration templates for those namespaces are submitted
		 and incorporated into the URN Namespace registry by IANA.
	   </t>
	   <t><cref>Note in draft: The more information that can be
		  supplied in the template or references from it, the better.
		  But, if there is information in the now-expired
		  Internet-Drafts (draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3187bis-isbn-urn,
		  draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3044bis-issn-urn) that should be
		  captured somewhere and that doesn't fit naturally in the
		  template, the discussion below is probably a reasonable
		  place to put it.</cref></t>
	   
	   <t>Those updated templates, as described in the following
		  subsections, reflect not only new formats but
		  substantive changes to the definitions of the
		  namespaces.</t>

	   <t>For both ISSN and ISBN URNs, it is intended that the
		  registrations track the evolution of ISO standardization
		  without requiring resubmission of the templates or other
		  formal IETF or IANA registration update approval
		  procedures.</t>

		  <section title="ISBN URN Changes">
			 <t>The revised ISBN namespace reflects the updated
				version of the ISO Standard for
				ISBNs, ISO 2108:2005 <xref target="ISO-ISBN-b"/> and
				allows for the use of both the ten character numbers
				described in RFC 3187 and the
				earlier ISO 2108:1992 <xref target="ISO-ISBN-a"/>
				(known as ISBN-10) and the expanded ones of the
				revised standard (known as ISBN-13).</t>
		  </section>
		  
		  <section title="ISSN URN Changes">
			 <t>The ISSN namespace is also updated to reflect changes
				between the ISSN Standard when RFC 3044 was written
				and the newest, 2007
				version <xref target="ISO-ISSN"/>.  </t>
		  </section>
		  
		  
	</section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations" anchor="IANAConsid">
      <t>IANA is requested to update the registry entries for URN
		 ISSNs, ISBNs, and NRNs to reflect the new, &RFC3406bis;-complaint
		 templates as soon as they are available and to no
		 longer reference the now-historic RFCs. Other registrations
		 and templates conforming to the newer rules may be
		 substituted for the older ones when they are available.
		 However, neither this document nor &RFC3406bis; invalidates
		 existing registrations other than those listed above, so IANA
		 needs to be prepared to maintain a registry whose contents
		 reflect both old and new templates.</t>
	  <t>IANA should also note that the portions of the registrations
		 that point to ISO Standards are intended to identify current
		 versions (which may change) rather than only the versions
		 that are active at the time this document is approved.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>While particular URN namespaces and their registrations might
		 conceivably have security implications, this specification
		 merely specifies a transition of a pair of registration
		 procedures and
		 does not have such implications.   The security implications
		 associated with particular namespaces are expected to be
		 listed in registration templates as specified in
		 &RFC3406bis;.</t>
    </section>

  	
    <section anchor="Acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">
	<t>This document draws heavily on discussions in the IETF URNbis
		Working Group in the second and third quarters of 2013, particularly
		during IETF 87 in August 2013, and on informal discussions during the
		plenary meeting of ISO TC 46 in June 2013.  The efforts of those who
		participated in those discussions are greatly appreciated.  It also
		draws on internet-drafts that were developed to update the older
		registrations before that approach was replaced by the new extended
		template model.  Those drafts were prepared by Pierre Godefroy, Juha
		Hakala, Alfred Hoenes, and Maarit Huttunen.</t>
