      <t>This document specifies the procedures and protocol extensions for
      the protection of mLDP nodes within Multi-Protocol Label Switching
      (MPLS) networks using P2MP backup LSPs.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>To meet user demand, operators and service providers continue to
      deploy multicast applications using the Multicast Label Distribution
      Protocol (Multicast LDP - mLDP) across MPLS networks. For real-time
      applications, such as stock trading, on-line games, and multimedia
      teleconference, traditional node protection mechanisms, such as relying
      on IGP re-convergence to build the new Label Switched Path (LSP), fail
      to achieve a protection switching time less than that which is required
      to minimize the interruption of applications.</t>

      <t>Instead of relying on IGP re-convergence to build the new LSP for
      failure protection, pre-computing and establishing a backup path before
      the failure delivers a better solution, allowing a more rapid switch
      over to the backup path when the protected node fails .</t>

      <t>Providing a pre-computed backup path requires solutions to two
      complex problems:<list style="symbols">
          <t>how to compute a completely disjoint backup path for each node in
          a multicast tree, and</t>

          <t>how to signal and setup the computed backup path.</t>
        </list>For a primary Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Path
      (LSP) created by LDP, there are several methods that could be chosen for
      creating a backup path:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The use of an RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol - RSVP -
          Traffic Engineering) point-to-point (P2P) tunnel as a logical
          out-going interface, which consequently utilizes the mature
          high-availability technology of RSVP-TE.</t>

          <t>The use of an alternative LDP P2P LSP as a packet encapsulation,
          which avoids the complex configuration of P2P RSVP-TE.</t>

          <t>Creating a P2MP backup LSP using a loop-free alternative route
          provided by the IGP.</t>

          <t>Using multi-topology technology, wherein the backup topology can
          be either statically configured or dynamically computed and signaled
          using IP/LDP Fast-Reroute mechanisms <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>When the backup path is available, there are two options for packet
      forwarding and protection switch over:</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="10" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Option 1">The traffic sender transmits the stream on
          both the primary and backup path always. Once the local traffic
          receiver detects a failure, the switch over will be relatively fast.
          However, the disadvantage of this method is that it consumes
          bandwidth because duplicate traffic will be sent on the primary and
          backup paths.</t>

          <t hangText="Option 2">The traffic sender transmits only on the
          primary path before the failure. Traffic is only forwarded to the MP
          through the backup path when failure is detected. Although bandwidth
          resource usage is minimized, cooperation is required to provide
          adequate switching times and to minimize higher-layer and
          application impact.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Ideally, if the switching time performance can be equal to or better
      than that of Option 1, it is reasonable to choose Option 2 to avoid
      bandwidth wastage. This consideration has been taken into account in
      making the recommendations in this document.</t>

      <t>Note that for the computation and configuration of the primary
      topology, the algorithm used could be the Loop-free Alternate (LFA)
      based [RFC5286], Maximally Redundant Tree (MRT) based <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"></xref> , or based on any
      other algorithms or methods available including static and offline
      tools; any such method can be used in conjunction with the mechanisms
      described in this document , which is limited to determining the nodes
      that should be spanned by the backup paths for the protection of a node
      in the primary multicast tree. In addition, the mechanism for detecting
      the node failure that will result in switchover to the backup pathis
      also outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Compared to a P2P LSP based solution, this P2MP LSP based solution
      not only uses mLDP mechanisms for both the primary path and backup
      paths, but also avoids unnecessary packet duplication where multiple P2P
      backup paths for the same node pass through.common nodes.</t>

      <t>The remainder of this document specifies the signaling procedures and
      protocol extensions for the P2MP LSP based mLDP node protection solution
      which was briefly introduced above.</t>

          path rejoin and merge. Since the backup path is a multicast tree
          there will generally be more than one merge point.</t>

          <t>Primary Transit Node (PTN): The node between the PLR and MP on
          the primary path.</t>

          <t>Secondary Transit Node (STN): A node on the backup path between
          the PLR and MP. There might be more than one STN on the backup path

    <section title="Scope">
      <t>This document specifies the signaling procedures and protocol

    <section title="Example of mLDP Node Protection">
      <t>By using the procedures introduced in section 5 plus the available
      backup path computation algorithms, MP can initiate the building of the
      backup mLDP LSP starting from the PLR, avoiding the PTN and reaching the
      MPs. In the case of a large number of MPs, the solution introduced in
      this draft can avoid unnecessary packet duplication between PLR and the
      merge points. If a backup multicast tree is built rather than individual
      LSPs from the PLR to each MP then common transit points on the backup
      tree that would otherwise have multiple unicast LSPs passing through
      them will be saved some bandwidth on their incoming links.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="mLDPLocalProtectionEx"></xref>, R2 is on the
      preferential signalling/data path from R4/5 to R1, and the secondary
      signalling/data path from R4/R5 to R1 is through R3. In this case , the
      mLDP LSP will be established according to the IGP preferential path as
      R1--R2--R4/R5. As an example, this figure takes R2 as the PTN though the
      PTN can be any Transit Node of the mLDP LSP. (We assume that all the
      nodes in <xref target="mLDPLocalProtectionEx"></xref> support this mLDP
      based node protection method.)</t>

      <t>In this scenario, if R2 is protected by two P2P LSPs as R1--R3--R4
      and R1--R3--R5 , the traffic will be duplicated on the link between R1
      and R3 when the primary traffic is switched into the secondary path, and
      R3 will receive two copies of the multicast packages. But, if R2 is
      protected by a mLDP LSP instead, R3 will only receive one copy of the
      stream, and thus there will be no packet duplication on the link between
      R1 and R3 when the failure happens.</t>

    <section title="Signaling Procedures for P2MP Based Node Protection">
      <t>This section introduces the signaling procedures of P2MP LSP's node
      protection using P2MP-based backup LSP for a Protected Node N.</t>

      <section title="The Computation of the Backup Path">
        <t>Obviously, the backup path can not go through the protected node N.
        This section discusses how to choose the backup upstream LSR to avoid
        N.</t>

        <t>Firstly, find the candidate upstream LSRs as below:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>MPs should preferentially choose the upstream LSRs on the
            shortest path as candidates, except node N. If no other upstream
            LSRs are on the shortest path, MPs should choose the next-hop on
            N's detour path as a candidate. The detour path can be an IGP-FRR
            path or other topology-based disjoint paths. The IGP-FRR path can
            be provided by LFA, U-Turn <cref>EBD: Needs references.</cref>,
            etc. The disjoint path can be provided by MT, MRT, etc. Choosing
            the candidates is a local decision and can be determined by
            configuration.</t>

            <t>The STN node MUST be chosen from the IGP next-hops on the
            shortest path toward the PLR within the topology specified in the
            FRR mLDP FEC element by the MT-ID (Multi-Topology Identifier)
            <cref>EBD: Multi-Topology IDs need some explanation - it appears
            here without any introduction and I (for one) have no idea why
            there might be several and what they might cover.</cref> field.
            The candidate upstream LSRs MUST NOT include the PTN.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Thus, each node can choose one upstream node from the candidate
        upstream LSRs as its backup upstream LSR via the algorithm described
        in Section 2.4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6388"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title=" The Procedures for MP, PTN, STN and PLR">
        <t>The procedures for P2MP Based Node Protection described in this
        document assumes the PLR is capable of node failure detection.</t>

        <t>We assume all the involved nodes have advertised their
        corresponding protection capabilities. And the following section
        specifies the signaling procedures of P2MP Based Node Protection.</t>

        <section title="MP's Procedures ">
          <t>Each non-Ingress LSR determines its own upstream LSR and sends
          out a label mapping message, in accordance with the procedures
          documented in <xref target="RFC6388"></xref> without any additional
          extension. And its upstream LSR will propagate a new label mapping
          message to its upstream LSR. In such cases, the non-Ingress LSR is
          the MP node (as R4, R5 in <xref
          target="mLDPLocalProtectionEx"></xref>), MP's upstream LSR is the
          protected node (as R2 in Figure 1), and the protected node's
          upstream node is PLR (as R1 in <xref
          target="mLDPLocalProtectionEx"></xref>).</t>

          <t>When one MP (as R4/R5 nodes in <xref
          target="mLDPLocalProtectionEx"></xref>) receives the Notification
          <cref>EBD: Norification of what?</cref>, it individually determines
          its secondary path toward the PLR according to the IGP routes. The
          algorithms for choosing/computing the backup path can be LFA, MRT or
          others. After the backup upstream LSR is chosen, MP will send out a
          FRR Label mapping message<cref>EBD: I thought that the mechanism
          didn't necessarily involved FRR... so why a FRR Label mapping
          message?</cref>, which includes the mLDP backup tree's key &lt;PLR,
          protected-node, original-mLDP-FEC&gt; and the MT-ID if the backup
          path is not in the default topology. Note that the label assigned
          for the primary path and the secondary path MUST be different to
          avoid having the MP feed primary traffic to its secondary path's
          downstream LSRs. In addition, the original-mLDP-FEC of the backup
          tree key is encoded in a special opaque value as introduced in
          section 7.3</t>
        </section>

        <section title="PTN's Procedures ">
          <t>After the Protected Node (as R2 in <xref
          target="mLDPLocalProtectionEx"></xref> ) determines its upstream LSR
          (as R1 in <xref target="mLDPLocalProtectionEx"></xref>), it will
          send the information (PLR's identify, mLDP FEC) via Notification
          messages to all its downstream nodes(MPs) immediately. If other LSRs
          become its downstream nodes later, it will send such announcements
          to its new MP(s).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="STN's Procedures">
          <t>When one node receives such aforementioned FRR label mapping
          messages, if it is not the PLR, it can consider itself a STN and
          will choose its backup upstream node toward PLR on the corresponding
          topology's shortest IGP path. To avoid the backup LSP going through
          the PTN, additional path selection rule(s) should be applied. A
          simple method is for the transit nodes to not choose the specified
          PTN as its upstream LSR for the backup LSP. Other methods, such as
          the not-via policy, are under study and will be added in the future.
          To make the primary and backup topologies rooted from PLR satisfy
          the 'maximum disjointed' requirement, they can either be configured
          through static configurations or be signaled dynamically through
          other mechanisms such as MRT.</t>

          <t>When a STN on the backup mLSP fails before the backup LSP is put
          into use, this will trigger a recalculation of the backup
          LSP(s).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="PLR's Procedures ">
          <t>When PLR(R1) receives the FRR label mapping message, it can
          identify that it is the PLR by the mLDP backup FEC elements. Thus,
          it will decode the special opaque value (which contains the primary
          mLDP FEC element, introduced in section 7.3) and generate the backup
          forwarding entry for the specific LSP, which is identified by the
          root address and opaque value in the special opaque value. It will
          also bind the backup forwarding state to the specific primary entry,
          which is indicated by the Protected Node address in the message.
          Note that there might be more than one backup forwarding entry for a
          specific protected node.</t>

          <t>When failure is detected by PLR, it will switch the traffic to
          the backup paths. MP will also locally choose which traffic to
          receive and merge this traffic back to the primary LSP. The switch
          over manner on PLR is specified in detail in the later section of
          this document.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="PLR's Switching Over Considerations">
        <t>This section provides two modes for Switch over when failure occurs
        using the Protection Option 2 described in section 1 where there is
        only one copy of the traffic sent out from the PLR both before the PTN
        fails and after the PTN fails.</t>

        <t>Depending on the capability of the MP node, MP node can set Node
        Failure (detection required) Flag in two modes.</t>

            <t hangText="Mode 1:">The MP sets the Node Failure Required Flag
            (in the P2MP Based MP Node Protection Status Element) as 'Y'. This
            means that the MP requires the PLR to have the capability of
            detecting the PTN's failure. In this case, if the PLR doesn't have
            the node failure detection capability, then the backup path will
            not be setup and no protection is setup for the PTN. If the PLR
            has the capability of detecting the PTN's failure, the backup path
            can be setup correctly and only after PLR detects that PTN's
            failure, there will be backup traffic forwarded through the backup
            path to the MP(s).</t>

            <t hangText="Mode 2:">The MP sets the Node Failure Required Flag,
            in the P2MP Based MP Node Protection Status Element, set as 'N'.
            This means that the MP has the capability of dropping duplicated
            multicast packages and doesn't require the PLR to have the
            capability of detecting the PTN's failure. In this case, PLR
            switches the traffic to the backup path once it detects the link
            failure between PLR and PTN no matter it is caused by the PTN's
            failure or not. In the case that it is a link failure case, and
            the link protection is also deployed, then the MP will receive two
            copies of the traffic, one copy from the normal link protection
            path, and one copy from the node protection path through STN. MP
            must take the responsibility to drop one of the two duplicate
            traffics when link fails between PLR and PTN.</t>

        label after the re-convergence. STN will delete the specified backup
        LSP just as in the procedure of deleting normal P2MP LSP. And the

        considerations:</t>

        <section title="MP's Procedure">
          <t>MP sends a backup label mapping message containing MP2MP
          downstream FRR FEC elements. When PLR receives a backup label
          mapping message with a MP2MP downstream flag, it sends the backup
          label mapping message with mp2mp upstream FRR FEC elements to Pn and
          then finally to MPs. This procedure just follows the normal MP2MP
          LSP procedure.</t>

          <t>For the forwarding entries, MP node binds its primary MP2MP
          downstream NHLFE entry to backup MP2MP downstream ILM entry and
          binds its backup MP2MP upstream NHLFE entry to primary MP2MP
          upstream ILM entry.</t>

          <t>For the forwarding entries, MP node binds its primary MP2MP
          downstream NHLFE entry to backup MP2MP downstream ILM entry and
          binds its backup MP2MP upstream NHLFE entry to primary MP2MP
          upstream ILM entry.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="PLR's Procedure">
          <t>PLR node binds its backup MP2MP downstream NHLFE entry to primary
          MP2MP downstream ILM entry, also binds its primary MP2MP upstream
          NHLFE entry to backup MP2MP upstream ILM entry.</t>

        <section title="Switch over Procedure">
          <t>When the protected node fails, both the affected downstream and
