      <section anchor="caching" title="Introduction">
         <t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level
   request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
   self-descriptive messages for flexible interaction with network-based
   hypertext information systems. HTTP is defined by a series of documents
   that collectively form the HTTP/1.1 specification:
</t>
         <ul>
            <li>"HTTP Semantics" <xref target="Semantics"/>
            </li>
            <li>"HTTP Caching" (this document)</li>
            <li>"HTTP/1.1 Messaging" <xref target="Messaging"/>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <t>
   HTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where
   performance can be improved by the use of response caches. This document
   defines aspects of HTTP related to caching and reusing response
   messages.
</t>
         <iref item="cache"/>
         <t>
   An HTTP cache is a local store of response messages and the
   subsystem that controls storage, retrieval, and deletion of messages in it.
   A cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response time and
   network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent requests. Any client or
   server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> employ a cache, though a cache cannot be used by a server that
   is acting as a tunnel.
</t>
         <iref item="shared cache"/>
         <iref item="private cache"/>
         <t anchor="shared.and.private.caches">
   A shared cache is a cache that stores responses to be reused
   by more than one user; shared caches are usually (but not always) deployed
   as a part of an intermediary. A private cache, in contrast,
   is dedicated to a single user; often, they are deployed as a component of 
   a user agent.
</t>
         <t>
   The goal of caching in HTTP is to significantly improve performance
   by reusing a prior response message to satisfy a current request.
   A stored response is considered "fresh", as defined in
   <xref target="expiration.model"/>, if the response can be reused without
   "validation" (checking with the origin server to see if the cached response
   remains valid for this request).  A fresh response can therefore
   reduce both latency and network overhead each time it is reused.
   When a cached response is not fresh, it might still be reusable if it can
   be freshened by validation (<xref target="validation.model"/>) or if the
   origin is unavailable (<xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).

       any overflow occurs, even if the calculations are performed with an
       arithmetic type incapable of directly representing that number.
       What matters here is that an overflow be detected and not treated as a

      <section anchor="caching.overview" title="Overview of Cache Operation">
         <iref item="cache key"/>
         <t>
   Proper cache operation preserves the semantics of HTTP transfers (<xref target="Semantics"/>) while reducing the transfer of information already
   held in the cache. Although caching is an entirely <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> feature of
   HTTP, it can be assumed that reusing a cached response is desirable and
   that such reuse is the default behavior when no requirement or local
   configuration prevents it. Therefore, HTTP cache requirements are focused
   on preventing a cache from either storing a non-reusable response or
   reusing a stored response inappropriately, rather than mandating that
   caches always store and reuse particular responses.
</t>
         <iref item="cache key"/>
         <t>
   The base cache key consists of the request method and target
   URI used to retrieve the stored response; the method determines under which
   circumstances that response can be used to satisfy a request. However, many
   HTTP caches in common use today only cache GET responses, and therefore only
   use the URI as the cache key, forwarding other methods.
</t>
         <t>
   If a request target is subject to content negotiation, the cache might
   store multiple responses for it. Caches differentiate these responses
   by incorporating values of the original request's selecting header fields
   into the cache key as well, as per <xref target="caching.negotiated.responses"/>.
</t>
         <t>
  Furthermore, caches might incorporate additional material into the cache key.
  For example, user agent caches might include the referring site's identity,
  thereby "double keying" the cache to avoid some privacy risks (see <xref target="security.timing"/>).
</t>
         <t>
   Most commonly, caches store the successful result of a retrieval
   request: i.e., a 200 (OK) response to a GET request, which
   contains a representation of the resource identified by the request target
   (<xref target="Semantics" section="7.3.1" relative="#GET"/>). However, it is also possible to store 
   redirects, negative results (e.g., 404 (Not Found)),
   incomplete results (e.g., 206 (Partial Content)), and
   responses to methods other than GET if the method's definition allows such
   caching and defines something suitable for use as a cache key.
</t>
         <t>
   A cache is disconnected when it cannot contact the origin
   server or otherwise find a forward path for a given request. A
   disconnected cache can serve stale responses in some circumstances (<xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).

   considered complete even though it might be indistinguishable from an
   incomplete response (see <xref target="Messaging" sectionFormat="comma" section="6.3" relative="#message.body.length"/>). A cache <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> consider a close-terminated

   When a cache receives a request that can be satisfied by a stored response
   that has a Vary header field (<xref target="Semantics" section="10.1.4" relative="#header.vary"/>),
   it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use that response unless all of the selecting header fields
   nominated by the Vary header field match in both the original request
   (i.e., that associated with the stored response), and the presented
   request.
</t>
            <t>
   The selecting header fields from two requests are defined to match if and
   only if those in the first request can be transformed to those in the
   second request by applying any of the following:
</t>
            <ul>
               <li>
     adding or removing whitespace, where allowed in the header field's
     syntax
  </li>
               <li>
     combining multiple header fields with the same field name
     (see <xref target="Semantics" section="4.2" relative="#field.values"/>)
  </li>
               <li>
     normalizing both header field values in a way that is known to have
     identical semantics, according to the header field's specification
     (e.g., reordering field values when order is not significant;
     case-normalization, where values are defined to be case-insensitive)
  </li>
            </ul>
            <t>
   If (after any normalization that might take place) a header field is absent
   from a request, it can only match another request if it is also absent
   there.

            <t>
   A Vary header field-value of "*" always fails to match.
</t>
            <t>
   The stored response with matching selecting header fields is known as the
   selected response.
</t>
            <t>
   If multiple selected responses are available (potentially including
   responses without a Vary header field), the cache will need to choose one to use.
   When a selecting header field has a known mechanism for doing so (e.g., qvalues on
   Accept and similar request header fields), that mechanism <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
   used to select preferred responses; of the remainder, the most recent
   response (as determined by the Date header field) is used, as
   per <xref target="constructing.responses.from.caches"/>.
</t>
            <t>
   Note that in practice, some resources might send the Vary header field on
   responses inconsistently. When a cache has multiple responses for a given
   target URI, and one or more omits the Vary header field, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the
   most recent non-empty value available to select an appropriate response
   for the request.
</t>
            <t>
   If no selected response is available, the cache cannot satisfy the 
   presented request. Typically, it is forwarded to the origin server 
   in a (possibly conditional; see <xref target="validation.model"/>) request.

   A fresh response is one whose age has not yet exceeded its
   freshness lifetime. Conversely, a stale
   response is one where it has.

            <t>
   A response's freshness lifetime is the length of time
   between its generation by the origin server and its expiration time. An
   explicit expiration time is the time at which the origin
   server intends that a stored response can no longer be used by a cache
   without further validation, whereas a heuristic expiration
   time is assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration time is
   available.
</t>
            <iref item="age"/>
            <t>
   A response's age is the time that has passed since it was
   generated by, or successfully validated with, the origin server.  
</t>
            <t>
   When a response is "fresh" in the cache, it can be used to satisfy
   subsequent requests without contacting the origin server, thereby improving
   efficiency.
</t>
            <t>
   The primary mechanism for determining freshness is for an origin server to
   provide an explicit expiration time in the future, using either the
   <xref target="header.expires" format="none">Expires</xref> header field (<xref target="header.expires"/>) or
   the max-age response directive (<xref target="cache-response-directive.max-age"/>). Generally, origin servers
   will assign future explicit expiration times to responses in the belief
   that the representation is not likely to change in a semantically
   significant way before the expiration time is reached.
</t>
            <t>
   If an origin server wishes to force a cache to validate every request, it
   can assign an explicit expiration time in the past to indicate that the
   response is already stale. Compliant caches will normally validate a stale
   cached response before reusing it for subsequent requests (see <xref target="serving.stale.responses"/>).
</t>
            <t>
   Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times,
   caches are also allowed to use a heuristic to determine an expiration time
   under certain circumstances (see <xref target="heuristic.freshness"/>).
</t>
            <t>
  The calculation to determine if a response is fresh is:
</t>
            <artwork type="code"><![CDATA[
   response_is_fresh = (freshness_lifetime > current_age)
]]></artwork>
            <t>
   freshness_lifetime is defined in <xref target="calculating.freshness.lifetime"/>; current_age is defined in
   <xref target="age.calculations"/>.
</t>
            <t>
   Clients can send the max-age or min-fresh request directives (<xref target="cache-request-directive"/>) to constrain or relax freshness
   calculations for the corresponding response. However, caches are not
   required to honor them.
</t>
            <t>
   When calculating freshness, to avoid common problems in date parsing:
</t>
            <ul>
               <li>Although all date formats are specified to be case-sensitive, 
      a cache recipient <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> match day, week, and time-zone names
      case-insensitively.</li>
               <li>If a cache recipient's internal implementation of time has less
      resolution than the value of an HTTP-date, the recipient <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
      internally represent a parsed <xref target="header.expires" format="none">Expires</xref> date as the
      nearest time equal to or earlier than the received value.</li>
               <li>A cache recipient <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> allow local time zones to influence the
      calculation or comparison of an age or expiration time.</li>
               <li>A cache recipient <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> consider a date with a zone abbreviation
      other than GMT or UTC to be invalid for calculating expiration.</li>
            </ul>
            <t>
   Note that freshness applies only to cache operation; it cannot be used to
   force a user agent to refresh its display or reload a resource. See <xref target="history.lists"/> for an explanation of the difference between

   freshness whose status codes are defined as "heuristically cacheable" (e.g., see

   </li>

     If the new response does not include any form of validator (such as in
     the case where a client generates an If-Modified-Since request from a

     only one stored response, and that stored response also lacks a

   response if the more efficient conditional GET request mechanism is not
   available (due to no validators being present in the stored response) or
   if transmission of the representation body is not desired even if it has
   changed.

   Because unsafe request methods (<xref target="Semantics" section="7.2.1" relative="#safe.methods"/>) such as PUT, POST or DELETE

   caches can use them to keep their contents up to date.

   A cache <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> invalidate the effective Request URI

   fields (if present) when a non-error status code is received in response to
   an unsafe request method.
</t>
            <t>
   However, a cache <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> invalidate a URI from a Location
   or Content-Location response header field if the host part of
   that URI differs from the host part in the effective request URI

</t>
            <t>
   Here, a "non-error response" is one with a 2xx (Successful)
   or 3xx (Redirection) status code. "Invalidate" means that
   the cache will either remove all stored responses related to the effective
   request URI or will mark these as "invalid" and in need of a mandatory
   validation before they can be sent in response to a subsequent request.
</t>
            <t>
   Note that this does not guarantee that all appropriate responses are
   invalidated. For example, a state-changing request might invalidate
   responses in the caches it travels through, but relevant responses still
   might be stored in other caches that it has not.

   The "max-stale" request directive indicates that the client is willing to
   accept a response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime. If a value is
   present, then the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded
   its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds. If
   no value is assigned to max-stale, then the client is willing to accept a
   stale response of any age.
</t>

   This directive uses the token form of the argument syntax:

   The "no-store" request directive indicates that a cache <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
   store any part of either this request or any response to it. This
   directive applies to both private and shared caches. "<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>

   without forwarding it for validation and receiving a successful response;
   see <xref target="validation.model"/>.
</t>
                  <t>
   The must-revalidate directive is necessary to support reliable operation
   for certain protocol features. In all circumstances a cache <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> obey
   the must-revalidate directive; in particular, if a cache is disconnected,
   it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a 504 (Gateway Timeout) response.

   For example, consider a hypothetical new response directive called

   prohibited, extremely large values have been demonstrated to cause 
   problems (e.g., clock overflows due to use of 32-bit integers for 
   time values), and many caches will evict a response far sooner than 
   that.

         <section anchor="header.pragma" title="Pragma">
            <iref item="Pragma header field" primary="true"/>
            <t>
   The "Pragma" header field was defined for HTTP/1.0 caches, so that clients
   could specify a "no-cache" request (as <xref target="header.cache-control" format="none">Cache-Control</xref> was
   not defined until HTTP/1.1).
</t>
            <t>
   However, support for Cache-Control is now widespread. As a result, this
   specification deprecates Pragma.
</t>
            <aside>
               <t>
      
                  <strong>Note:</strong> Because the meaning of "Pragma: no-cache" in responses was never
      specified, it does not provide a reliable replacement for
      "Cache-Control: no-cache" in them.
   </t>

         <section anchor="header.warning" title="Warning">
            <iref item="Warning header field" primary="true"/>
            <t>
   The "Warning" header field was used to carry additional information
   about the status or transformation of a message that might not be reflected
   in the status code. This specification obsoletes it, as it is not widely
   generated or surfaced to users. The information it carried can be gleaned
   from examining other header fields, such as <xref target="header.age" format="none">Age</xref>.
</t>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="history.lists" title="Relationship to Applications">
         <t>
   Applications using HTTP often specify additional forms of caching. For
   example, Web browsers often have history mechanisms such as "Back" buttons
   that can be used to redisplay a representation retrieved earlier in a
   session.
</t>
         <t>
   Likewise, some Web browsers implement caching of images and other assets
   within a page view; they may or may not honor HTTP caching semantics.
</t>
         <t>
   The requirements in this specification do not necessarily apply to how
   applications use data after it is retrieved from a HTTP cache. That is, a
   history mechanism can display a previous representation even if it has
   expired, and an application can use cached data in other ways beyond its
   freshness lifetime.
</t>
         <t>
   This does not prohibit the application from taking HTTP caching into
   account; for example, a history mechanism might tell the user that a view
   is stale, or it might honor cache directives (e.g., Cache-Control:
   no-store).
</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="security.considerations" title="Security Considerations">
         <t>
   This section is meant to inform developers, information providers, and
   users of known security concerns specific to HTTP caching.
   More general security considerations are addressed in HTTP messaging
   <xref target="Messaging"/> and semantics <xref target="Semantics"/>.
</t>
         <t>
   Caches expose additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of
   the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation.
   Because cache contents persist after an HTTP request is complete, an attack
   on the cache can reveal information long after a user believes that the
   information has been removed from the network. Therefore, cache contents
   need to be protected as sensitive information.
</t>
         <section title="Cache Poisoning">
            <t>
   Various attacks might be amplified by being stored in a shared cache. Such
   "cache poisoning" attacks use the cache to distribute a malicious payload
   to many clients, and are especially effective when an attacker can use
   implementation flaws, elevated privileges, or other techniques to insert
   such a response into a cache.
</t>
            <t>
   One common attack vector for cache poisoning is to exploit differences in
   message parsing on proxies and in user agents; see <xref target="Messaging" section="6.3" relative="#message.body.length"/> for the relevant requirements regarding
   HTTP/1.1.
</t>
         </section>
         <section anchor="security.timing" title="Timing Attacks">
            <t>
   Because one of the primary uses of a cache is to optimise performance,
   its use can "leak" information about what resources have been previously
   requested. 
</t>
            <t>
   For example, if a user visits a site and their browser caches some of its
   responses, and then navigates to a second site, that site can attempt to
   load responses that it knows exists on the first site. If they load very
   quickly, it can be assumed that the user has visited that site, or even
   a specific page on it.
</t>
            <t>
   Such "timing attacks" can be mitigated by adding more information to the
   cache key, such as the identity of the referring site (to prevent the
   attack described above). This is sometimes called "double keying."
</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Caching of Sensitive Information">
            <t>
   Implementation and deployment flaws (as well as misunderstanding of cache
   operation) might lead to caching of sensitive information (e.g.,
   authentication credentials) that is thought to be private, exposing it to
   unauthorized parties.
</t>
            <t>
   Note that the Set-Cookie response header field <xref target="RFC6265"/>
   does not inhibit caching; a cacheable response with a Set-Cookie header
   field can be (and often is) used to satisfy subsequent requests to caches.
   Servers who wish to control caching of these responses are encouraged to
   emit appropriate Cache-Control response header fields.
