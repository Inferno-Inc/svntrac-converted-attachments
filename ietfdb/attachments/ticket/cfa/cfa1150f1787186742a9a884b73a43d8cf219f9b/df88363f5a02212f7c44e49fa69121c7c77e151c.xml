      <name>Introduction</name>
      
      <t>During the early weeks and months of the COVID-19 pandemic <xref target="WHO-Declaration" />, significant changes to Internet usage occurred as a 
		result of a sudden global shift to people working, studying and quarantining at home. One aspect that this affected 
		was interconnection between networks, which this paper studies.</t>
		
		<t>In 2016, the Interconnection Measurement Project <xref target="Tinker-Blog" /> was launched. The IMP platform initially collected interconnection-related data from seven U.S.-based cable-based Internet Service 
		Providers (ISPs) and an <xref target="ArXiv-Paper" /> shared some of the details and findings.</t>
	    
	    <t>This paper looks specifically at the long-term interconnection data from one of those ISPs, Comcast. We examine the long-term 
	    pre-COVID-19 trend as well as what occurred as COVID-19 impacted the Internet from February 2020 through August 2020. We also 
	    include observations by Comcast concerning interconnection changes during this timeframe.</t>
	    
	    <t>We hope that this information will be useful to the IAB workshop and the Internet community more broadly. As well, it may serve 
	    as an interesting and useful historical reference in the future.</t>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Long-Term Interconnection Data</name>

            <t>The IMP platform collected interconnection data starting in 2016, roughly four years prior to the COVID-19-driven shift in 
	    Internet usage. This provides an interesting capability for a before and after view of interconnection. A full explanation 
		    of the data can be found in Section 3 of the <xref target="ArXiv-Paper" />. At a high level, the key data collected 
		    encompasses:</t>
		    <ul>
			    <li>Timestamp (representing a five-minute interval)</li>
			    <li>Region (representing an aggregated link group)</li>
			    <li>Anonymized partner network</li>
			    <li>Access ISP</li>
			    <li>Total ingress bytes</li>
			    <li>Total egress bytes</li>
			    <li>Capacity</li>
		    </ul>
	    
	    <t>The Comcast part of this long timeframe data set shows the following (Nick - include some stats and charts here. 
	    maybe total capacity over time, utilization over time, and cap and util by the partner nets with biggest covid changes. We 
	    can then later do so deep dive views of each partner net.)</t>

      <name>Comcast's COVID-19-Related Experiences</name>

            <t>Comcast observed a wide range of significant changes in Internet usage as residential users remained at home and 
	    shifted to working and studying from home. Changes in usage patterns observed in the access network in sum led to 
	    changes in the traffic flowing to interconnected networks.</t>
	    
	    <t>At the peak of the surge, in March and April 2020, Comcast observed network traffic increase over 30% and 
		    as high as 60% in some areas. Voice &amp; video conferencing (conferencing hereafter) jumped as much as 
		    285% and Wi-Fi use increased 36% among our Xfinity Mobile (MVNO) customers 
		    (<xref target="June-Blog" /> and 
		    <xref target="July-Blog" />. As this continued 
		    into May 2020 we observed conferencing remained up roughly 210-285%, VPN traffic up 30-40% and gaming downloads 
		    up 20-80%, and web-based streaming video consumption up 20-40% 
		    <xref target="May-Blog" />. In this several week period, traffic essentially 
	    grew at or more than it had in the prior year, which was an astounding amount or growth in a short period of time.</t>
	    
	    <t>For the six month period from March to August 2020, Comcast observed:</t>
		    <ul>
			    <li>Overall average downstream peak growth is up 14%.</li>
			    <li>Overall average upstream peak growth is up 27%.</li>
			    <li>At its highest peak during this time, downstream traffic was up by 20.1% and 
				    upstream traffic was up by 35.1%.</li>
			    <li>In the access network, an average of 771 network augments per week were performed, peaking 
				    at over 1,800 in a single week and over with over 7 weeks with more than 1,000 per week. For 
			    comparison, the average earlier in the year was roughly 350 per week.</li>
			    <li>In the core network, 493 augments were made in order to add 135 Tbps in capacity.</li>
			    <li>On a daily basis between 550,000 - 700,000 automated speed tests from customer homes were 
				    conducted in order to gauge the customer experience during this time. Average speeds 
				    to customers (both downstream and upstream) have generally 
				    remained at or above 105% of advertised speeds since March 1, 2020 in all regions. 
				    National average speeds have remained above 110% of advertised speeds over the same period. 
				    <xref target="NF-Paper-1" /> and <xref target="NF-Paper-2" /></li>
			    <li>The share of streaming video as a percentage of total traffic is declined slightly from 67% to 63%. 
				    Despite strong growth, conferencing occupies a small share of total traffic and grew from 1% share 
				    to 4%. But gaming software released have driven significant download spikes since late April 2020.</li>
			    <li>For interconnection, the informal prior threshold for adding capacity was when peak 95th percentile 
				    utilization hit 75% - 80%. As a result of rapid changes in early 2020, we observed that many 
				    peering coordinators shifted to 50% due to how rapidly growth was occurring. Prior to the pandemic in February 2020
				    the network had 10 links above threshold for augment, rising quickly to 121 within a month, falling back to just 1 by June 
				    2020. </li>
			    <li>As interconnection capacity was added it was exclusively via 100 Gbps links, rather than slower speed links, 
			    in order to provide ample capacity for future growth.</li>
		    </ul>
	    <t>In 2019, interconnection capacity grew by 13%. The nine months of 2020, driven by COVID-19 changes, saw a 41% increase in capacity to 
		    over 10 Tbps total. (((NICK - We need to ensure this squares with the IMP data)))</t>
	    <t>Between September 2019 and September 2020, interconnection capacity grew by 50%.</t>
	    <t>In the smaller period between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, inbound interconnection traffic at the 95th percentile grew by 110%. By September 2, 2020, 
	    traffic had settled to a lower level that represented 31% growth from March and 46% growth annual growth from September 2019.</t>
