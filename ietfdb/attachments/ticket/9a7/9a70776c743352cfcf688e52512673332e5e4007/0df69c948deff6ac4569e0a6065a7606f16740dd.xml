    <date month="January" day="11" year="2014" />
      <t>The history of the DNS has included a great deal of confusion
		 about terminology.  That confusion has led to discussions in
		 which  different parties have used the same words for different
		 things.  The term "host name" has been a particular source of
		 confusion and associated problems
		 (see <xref target="WhatHostName"/>.
		 While 
		 established inconsistent uses may be impossible to correct,
		 it is in the interest of the community to avoid increasing
		 the confusion by adding new terms with multiple and
		 conflicting meanings.</t>
	  <t>In recent months, there have been a number of discussions of
		 "dotless domains", apparently starting with several
		 discussions about possible new gTLDs (generic Top Level
		 Domains) in the ICANN context.
		 Those discussions have included statements by ICANN's Security
		 and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) <xref target="SAC053"/>
		 (referred to as the "SSAC report" below) and the Internet
		 Architecture Board (IAB) <xref target="IAB-Dotless"/>
		 (referred to as the "IAB report" below), 
		 a survey of the resource records associated with
		 each TLD <xref target="RFC7085"/> (the "Levine-Hoffman
		 study"), and an analysis of the use
		 of such domains in various protocols <xref target="dotless-case"/>.
		 At least four different definitions have been used or
		 assumed in the various discussions:
		 <list style="numbers">
			<t>Naked domain label without any period(s), including
			   missing the terminating one (SSAC report and probably
			   the IAB report, although the latter is less clear).</t>
		    <t>Top-level domain name used without subdomains (several
			   instances around ICANN including some staff comments).</t>
			<t>Top-level domain containing address records
			   (Levine-Hoffman survey).</t>
			<t>Top-level domain containing records other than one with an SOA
			   RRTYPE and records associated with delegation only (a
			   different variation on the definition used by Hoffman
			   and Levine that would consider TLDs that contain, e.g.,
			   NAPTR, URI, or MX records and avoid any confusion about
			   "glue").</t>
		</list></t>
	 <t> The first of these assumes that a "dotless domain" may
		actually be a label that is subject to completion or search
		rules to form a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) with more
		than one label.  The others assume that only top-level domains
		are intended.</t>
	 <t> This document expresses no opinion about the desirability or
		appropriateness of use of "dotless domains" (however defined).
		It is only about the terminology and its use.
	    If such opinions are desired, they can be found in abundance
		in several of the referenced documents.</t>

	<section title="The Humpty Dumpty and Queen of Hearts Syndromes"
			anchor="HumptyQueen"> 
	   <t>Note: Those for whom these metaphorical references are not
		  familiar may want to consult <xref target="WhatsACarroll"/>
		  </t>
	   <t>Humpty Dumpty <xref target="Dumpty"/> is famously quoted
		  as saying "When I use a 
		  word, it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more
		  nor less".  When there is 
		  actually more than one definition, that approach
		  works as long as the term is carefully defined, each
		  document and context that uses it clearly identifies which
		  definition it is using, and that people remember to read the
		  definitions and know which one applies.  At least when the
		  DNS is involved, those conditions
		  are rarely met, as evidenced by the discussions cited
		  above.</t>
	   <t> When one reads a discussion about a "dotless domain" (or a
		  "host name") without a clear and clearly understood binding
		  to a particular definition and especially if strong opinions
		  are expressed about utility or importance, one is likely to
		  fall into what 
		  we might call the Queen of Hearts <xref target="Queen"/>
		  variation on the Humpty Dumpty theme, i.e., "you have to
		  guess what I meant and, if you get it wrong, off with your
		  head".</t>
	   <t> Being headless rarely contributes positively to either
		  protocol or policy discussions.  Neither does confusion
		  about contradictory terminology, even if one is permitted to
		  keep one's head.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="Dotless and the DNS Definition"
			anchor="dotless1034"> 
	   <t>Various very informal uses aside, "dotless domain" actually
		  comes close to being an oxymoron.  The basic definition of
		  DNS concepts <xref target="RFC1034"/> 
		  specifies that every complete domain name ends in a dot
		  (representing the root) whether that dot is actually written
		  out or not.   Specifically, it says
		  <list style="none">
			 <t>"Since a complete domain name ends with the root label,
				this leads to a printed form which ends in a dot."
				<vspace blankLines="1"/> and </t>
			 <t>"so a multi-label relative name is often one where the
				trailing dot has been omitted to save typing."</t>
		  </list></t>
	   <t>Put differently, the trailing dot is always there in
		  user-form FQDNs whether one sees it or not.  If there is
		  such a thing as a "dotless domain", it is a deliberately
		  relative reference.   That is not what usually seems to
		  be intended by the term, although it is a case the SSAC and
		  IAB reports explicitly discuss.</t>
	   <t> Depending on the particular use or context, more exact
		  terms might include "label", "single-label domain name
		  string", "top-level domain name used alone",
		  "top-level domain that is not delegation-only",
		  and so on, including variations on that list.</t> 
    </section>

	<section title="Recommendation">
	   <t>Especially in documents that are intended to represent
		  precise statements of technology, recommendations, or
		  policy, "dotless domain" should be eliminated from the vocabulary,
		  replacing it with terms that actually mean something and
		  have precise interpretations, such at the examples at the
		  end of <xref target="dotless1034"/>.
		  Even in less formal statements and documents, its use should
		  either be avoided or carefully examined and questioned to
		  be sure that the author and reader share an understanding
		  about what is intended.</t>

	   <t> The characters, references, and metaphors of
		   <xref target="HumptyQueen"/> and at least the title of
		   <xref target="RabbitHole"/> are to a pair of books from
		   nineteenth century England <xref target="Queen"/>
		   <xref target="Dumpty"/> that 
		   are usually described as children's stories or fantasies.
		   Parts of both have also been extensively analyzed as social 
		   satire and logic exercises.  They are
		   fairly well known culturally in some areas, having been
		   adapted into multiple motion pictures and other works.  If
		   interpreted as children's books from nearly a century and a
		   half ago,  their match to current IETF (and related)
		   discussions should act as a caution about self-defined,
		   poorly-defined and localized terminology.  If viewed,
		   instead, as exercises and demonstrations in logic and, for
		   the first reference, in the nature of names and naming, the
		   caution should be even stronger.</t>

	<section title="Down the Rabbit Hole" anchor="RabbitHole">
	<section title="What is a Hostname?" anchor="WhatHostName">
	   <t>
         "Host name" has been used to describe  
		 both fully-qualified domain names with particular properties
		 such as address records <xref target="HostAsAddress"/>,
		 a practice that follows the pre-DNS "host table" use of that
		 term <xref target="RFC0952"/>
		 and the first label component of such names (e.g., "foo" in
		 "foo.example.com"). </t>
	  <t>A current Wikipedia article <xref target="Wiki-Hostname"/> illustrates
		 all of the confusion referred 
		   to above: the first label of the domain, the complete
		   domain name, only some domain names, and so on.  It is
		   probably consistent if read carefully enough, but the
		   distinctions and multiple uses are very subtle.</t>
	   <t> The "host as first label" model is also used in the
		  configuration 
		   mechanisms of several major operating systems.  For example
		   Windows 7 (and most of its predecessors) gives a computer
		   a name "in a domain" and handles the two separately. By
		   contrast, current versions of FreeBSD (9.0 and later)
		   consider a "hostname" to be an FQDN (see Section 2.5.2 of
		   the FreeBSD Handbook <xref target="FreeBSD-HB"/>).</t>
	   <t> By contrast, the ISC DHCP Server uses "domain-name" to
		   designate the containing domain and "host" to designate an
		   unqualified host name to which the domain names is
		   appended.</t>

	<section title='An Imagined History of "dotless domain"'>
	   <t>"Dotless domain" is not the first term to enter the
		  Internet's DNS vocabulary through less formal discussions
		  and then become a problem due to conflicting uses.  The
		  history of "dotless domain" and that distinction may belong
		  to "dot-com".  The latter
		  actually interacts with the discussion about all domain
		  names ending in implicit or explicit dots in
		  <xref target="dotless1034"/> above.  Because of that
		  interaction, the term probably should have
		  been "com-dot", rather than "dot-com".  More important,
		  once one believes that "dot-foo" is standard and precise
		  terminology for the name of a top-level domain,
		  "no-dot-foo" or "dotless-foo" seems natural and it is only
		  a half-step to "dotless domain".</t>
